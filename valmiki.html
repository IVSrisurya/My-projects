<p>
The boy born to sage Prachetasa was given the name Ratnakara by his parents. it's said that when Ratnakara was a couple of years old, he wandered into a forest and got lost. The young boy was found by a hunter who adopted and raised him. Under his foster father's guidance, Ratnakara also grew up to become an accomplished hunter.

The journey of Ratnakara into Valmiki</h3>
<p>
Though born in to a brahmin family, Ratnakar had turned bandit by with bad of others. He wont to loot the people that would travel through the lonely paths of wood. One day, Narada Munni was crossing by the wood where Ratnakar wont to reside and loot When he saw Narada, he challenged Narada to prevent . Unafraid by him, Narada turned to him and said, Look brother, I don't possess anything that you simply would really like to require . Why are you engage in killing innocent there's no sin greater than killing another fellow-mate. And for whom you're committing such heinous crime ?</p>
<p>
Ratnakar was familiar with watching frightened faces that wont to cry and beg for his mercy. Ratnakar was astonished to ascertain Narada, he wasn't bit afraid and moreover had the courage to question him. He was by Narada and answered, to feed my large family, I loot and take their wealth. Narada replied: Brother, go and ask them if they're willing to share your sins for whom you're committing these sinful actions. and do not think that i might run away, if you do not believe me then you an tie me with this rope to the tree. </p>
<p>
<div style=" width: 40%;float: left;"><img src="valmiki_content2.png" width="100%" height="50%" style="filter: brightness(1.2);" ></div>
Ratnakar after tying Narad with the visited his home and asked everybody an equivalent question: Is anybody able to share my sins?" an equivalent reply came from each of his family: it's your duty to seem after me, to feed us. it's not my concern on by which method you earn wealth, so why should I share your sins? " Ratnakar was disillusioned. He who was toiling, committing sins, taking risks, day and night for them and here they weren't even able to share his sins. He saw the futility of his actions he had committing. Ratnakar went back to the forest and untying Narada fell at his feet and began crying and said: O learned man, how can a mean person like me achieve salvation?
</p>

Narada after thinking for a short time asked him to chant the name of God Rama except for Ratnakar even pronouncing it had been difficult. When Narada saw that even after trying very hard, Ratnakar wasn't successful in his to chant Rama's name, he asked him to pronounce it backwards that's 'Mara ' then Narada went away. Ratnakar began to chant 'Mara, Mara' sitting there. He continued with this chant for 4 days, months, years and even Yuga! He didn't rise up for one moment, even opened his eyes. His body was so still that termites made his body their home and his whole body was covered with them.

Story behind Becoming the first poet</h3>

<p>
One day, Devamuni Narada was conversing with sage Valmiki and happened to inform him the story of Maryada Purushottam Rama, describing Rama’s many qualities, including truthfulness, bravery, self-competence, and wisdom.
After Narada left, Valmiki visited the Tamasa river for his mid-day baths, where he spotted two crane birds calling to every other and mating. Valmiki was crammed with joy seeing the happy birds. Suddenly, an arrow pierced the body of the male bird, killing him immediately. crammed with sorrow, his mate died of shock. Upon seeing this, the enraged rishi couldn't control himself and cursed Orion .
</p>
<p>
Although he was grief-stricken and in a lot of pain over the death of the innocent creatures, he couldn’t help but notice that the curse he uttered came out in a musical form that could be recited or sung. He narrated the entire incident to his disciple Bhardwaja, who memorised the couplet uttered by the sage while in grief. This then became the first-ever shloka in Sanskrit literature. 
</p>
<div style=" width: 40%;float: right;"><img src="valmiki_content3.png" width="100%" height="400vh" ></div>
<p>
The sage continued to brood over the incident, until, one day, Brahma appeared before him and asked him to urge over his grief. He inspired the guru to compose the story of Rama within the same poetic meter during which he had cursed Orion .To do this, Brahma bestowed on him the divine power to ascertain all that happened, even the thoughts of the characters. With these divine powers, he was ready to see the whole lifetime of Rama, the past, this , and therefore the future. Thus, Valmiki composed one among the longest works of literature the planet has ever known, the epic that came to be called the Ramayana, comprising 24,000 verses across seven kandas, divided into 500 saragas.
Story of Ramayana by Valmiki</p>
<p>
Once upon a time, while the sage Valmiki was performing austerities on the back of the river Tamasa, Narada Muni appeared before him and narrated a summary of the Ramayana, called the "Mula-ramayana" or the Original Ramayana. After hearting the mula-ramayana, the sage Valmiki composed thousands of Sanskrit verses to elaborately narrate all then incidents in this great epic. 

</p>
<p>
In the opening chapter, while eulogizing [to speak or write in high praise of] Rama, Narada gives an overview of Ramayana, truly highlighting those aspects that are the keynotes during this epic, like virtuosity, generosity, morality, chastity and therefore the like.In the first chapter of Bala Kanda the gist [the main points] of Ramayana is imbibed [absorbed] and it called samkshepa [summarized] Ramayana, or also called Bala Ramayana. the kids are asked to recite these stanzas daily for longevity and an ideal personality like that of Rama.
Valmiki Ramayana is claimed to possess been composed basing on each of the twenty-four letters of Gayatri Hymn, and thousand verses are arranged into one book under the caption of every letter.

Lord Brahma blessed sage Valmiki, by the facility of which he was ready to pen down the exploits of Sri Rama through his own work. This work was to qualify because the very backbone of Shastras, the repository of data within Sanatana Dharma. He took up the initiative to expand the 32 verses of sage Narada into 24,000 verses to make the whole body of labor called the Valmiki Ramayana.

<p>
Kandas had already gone by . At the time when he was still composing the verses, the 7th Kanda named Uttara Kanda was underway when Srimati Seeta Devi had taken shelter within the Valmiki Ashram following which the sons of Sri Rama Luv and Kush were born within the Ashram. because the princes Luv and Kush grew up in Ashram, Sage Valmiki consummated the ultimate Uttara Kanda of the Ramayana. it had been during this point that Sri Rama had found out a camp at Naimasharanya to carry the Ashvamedha Yajna. Under these circumstances, by the arrangement of Providence the 2 princes Luv and Kush wearing the apparel of renunciant brahmacharis sang the Ramayana of Sage Valmiki ahead of Sri Rama and His entourage. Sri Rama was so impressed by the rendition of the 2 princes that He expressed 
His great desire to satisfy the spiritual master of the 2 children. He sent Bharata to the Ashram of Sage Valmiki, to ask the sage for a gathering with the Lord. Sage Valmiki, along side Srimati Seeta Devi visited meet the Lord along side Bharata. The twins Luv and Kush were already at the camp with the Lord when sage Valmiki arrived along side Srimati Seeta Devi.
</p>
<p>
The event of Srimati Devi being consumed by Bhumi Devi , the world also of ascension of Sri Rama to Sri Vaikuntha was already included within the Ramayana poem that Luv and Kush recited before the Lord. Sage Valmiki is Trikala darshi, the knower of past, present and future.
He had composed the Ramayana by the grace of Sri Brahma. Thus 6 Kandas had already manifested and therefore the 7th Kanda was close to manifest at the time of the primary rendition of the Ramayana.

Tulsidas as the reincarnation of Valmiki</h3>
    <p>
In Bhavishya Purana, Lord Shiva told Goddess Parvathy that Valmiki would take birth as Tulsidas in Kali Yuga. Valmiki was blessed by Hanuman that he would sing the glory of Lord Rama and for that, he would be born in Kali Yuga.Valmiki wrote Ramayana in Sanskrit.
Lord Hanuman wanted to listen to Ramayana from the mouth of Valmiki but was not accepted by Valmiki because he was a monkey. Hanuman after the destruction of Ravana, visited the Himalayas and wrote Rama Katha by engraving the scenes on rocks. Valmiki felt that Hanuman’s narration could supersede his Ramayana. Understanding this, Hanuman threw the engraved rocks into the ocean but instructed Valmiki to be reborn as Tulsidas and write Ramakatha in his vernacular language Awadhi.
