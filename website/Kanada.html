When the whole people credit the Western World for contemporary physics and its development, it's India’s own scientist “Sage Kanad”, otherwise referred to as “Acharya Kanad”, who should be highly revered and credited. He discovered the atomic structure, atomic theory, and even sub-atomic particles some 2600 years before. Kanad in Sanskrit denotes the littlest particle.
He is revered because the “Father of Atomic Theory”. He has rendered Kanada Sutras, which are the Aphorisms of Kanada, which is taken into account together of the best works within the field of physics. he's not only revered in Hinduism but also in Jainism and Buddhism, where his concepts are highly praised.
</p><h3>
Early Life</h3><p> 
He was believed to possess born within the year 600 BC or 800 BC in Gujarat, India. His father was a philosopher Ulka. His birth name was Kashyap. As a toddler , he always accompanied his father and observed many things. But despite of all those things around him, his interest was always on the littlest things. He was ready to look beyond the overall concepts which were underlying within the universe.
When he was ready to conceptualize the thought of the littlest particle, he noted down his ideas and was ready to explain it to people. many of us also with great reverence call him Acharya Kanad.</p><h3>

Legend of Acharya Kanad</h3><p>
When Acharya Kanad was young, he always admired the grain of rice. it had been the tradition of the first Hindu family, to scatter grains of rice along the streets, for the people to follow it as a ritual. The young boy was watching the ant, which was eating the rice. He was fascinated by the thought that alittle piece of rice could become food for alittle creature like an ant, but it needs tons of grains, collected together to form an entire meal for an individual , which could satiate his hunger.
The idea of looking deep and beyond was highly fascinating, and he began to look deep into the rice particle, which suggested to him the concept of “Anu”, the littlest particle.
</p><h4>
Ideology</h4><p>
Physics is central to Kaṇāda's assertion that all that is knowable is based on motion. His ascribing centrality to physics in the understanding of the universe also follows from his invariance principles. For example, he says that the atom must be spherical since it should be the same in all dimensions. He asserts that all substances are composed of four types of atoms, two of which have mass and two are massless.
Kanada presents his work within a larger moral framework by defining Dharma as that which brings about material progress and highest good. He follows this Sutra with another that asserts that the Vedas have gained respect because they teach such Dharma, and something is not Dharma simply because it is in the Vedas.</p><p>

He asserts that each one substances are composed of 4 sorts of atoms, two of which have mass and two are massless.

He follows this Sutra with another that asserts that the Vedas have gained respect because they teach such Dharma, and something isn't Dharma just because it's within the Vedas.
Kanada and early Vaisheshika scholars focused on the evolution of the universe by law. However, this wasn't unusual for his times since several major early versions of Hindu philosophies like Samkhya, Nyaya, Mimamsa along side sub-schools of Yoga and Vedanta, also as non-Vedic schools like Jainism and Buddhism, were similarly non-theistic. Kanada was among the sages of India who believed in man's potential to know existence and reach moksha on his own, without God, a notion of ancient Indians summarized by Nietzsche because the belief that "with piety and knowledge of the Veda, nothing is impossible".</p><h3>
The text states: </h3><p>
•There are nine components of realities: four classes of atoms (earth, water, light and air), space (akasha), time (kāla), direction (disha), infinity of souls (Atman), mind (manas). </p><p>
•Every elementwhich exists is made of atoms (paramāṇu) which attaches with each other to form molecules (aṇu). Atoms are permanent, and their combinations constitute the material world.</p><p>
•Souls of human are eternal and pervade material bodies for a time.</p><p>
•There are six categories (padārtha) of experience — substance, quality, activity, generality, particularity, and inherence.</p><p>
Several traits of substances (dravya) are given as colour, taste, smell, touch, number, size, the separate, coupling and uncoupling, priority and posterity, comprehension, pleasure and pain, attraction and revulsion, and wishes.</p><p>
Thus the idea of the subdivision is carried further to analytical categories as well, which explains its affinity with Nyaya.</p><p>
Apart from this Kaṇāda  already presented the same laws of motion attributed to Newton, in the Vaiśeṣika Sutras.</p><p>
वेगः निमित्तविशेषात कर्मणो जायते। वेगः निमित्तापेक्षात कर्मणो जायते नियतदिक क्रियाप्रबन्धहेतु। वेगः संयोगविशेषविरोधी॥</p><p>
Meaning, action on objects generates motion. The external action being direction causes the motion to be directional. An equal and opposite action can neutralize the motion.
</p><h3>
Observations and theories</h3><p>
In the fifth chapter of Vaisheshika Sutra, Kanada mentions physical world observations and natural occuring events such as the falling of objects to the ground, rising of fire and heat upwards, the nature of rainfall and thunderstorms, the flow of liquids, about magnet , attempts to integrate his observations with his theories on atoms, molecules, and their interaction. He classifies observed phenomnens those caused by volition, and those caused by subject-object interactions.</p><p>
His idea of the observer, that is the subject, being different from objective reality is completely consistent with Vedanta, which speaks of the difference between "Apara" and "Para" knowledge, where "Apara" represents normal associational knowledge whereas "Para" represents deeper subjective knowledge.</p><h3>
The concept of anu (atom)</h3><p>
Kanada proposes that paramanu (atom) is an indestructible particle of matter. The atom is indivisible because it's a state at which no measurement are often attributed. He used invariance arguments to work out properties of the atoms. He also stated that anu can have two states -- absolute rest and a state of motion.</p><p> 
Adherents of the varsity of philosophy founded by Kanada considered the atom to be indestructible, and hence eternal. They believed atoms to be minute objects invisible to the eye which inherit being and vanish in a moment . Vaiseshikas further held that atoms of an equivalent substance combined with one another to supply dvyanuka (diatomic molecules) and tryanuka (triatomic molecules). Kanada also suggests the thought that atoms might be combined in various ways to supply chemical changes in presence of other factors like heat. He gave blackening of earthen pot and ripening of fruit as samples of this phenomenon. </p><p>
Kanada postulated four different sorts of atoms: two with mass, and two without. Each substance is meant to contains all four sorts of atoms.
Kanada's conception of the atom was likely independent from the similar concept among the traditional Greeks, due to the differences between the theories. for instance , Kanada suggested that atoms as building blocks differ both qualitatively and quantitatively, while Greeks suggested that atoms differed only quantitatively but not qualitatively.
Thus, great philosophers and Saints like Sage Kanad were parallelly ready to travel on both philosophy and spirituality. He has made several people believe science and was an excellent inspiration for several other philosophers and thinkers.
