V</span>edangas virtually mean the limbs of the Vedas. A bit like the limbs of the body, they perform varied confirming and augmenting functions within the preservation and protection of the Vedas and also the religious writing traditions. The Vedangas are six auxiliary disciplines in Hinduism that developed in the earlier period, and has been connected with the study of the Vedas.</p><p>The Vedangas square measure the last treatises of the Veda. Paniniya Shiksha narrates 2 verses on the importance of the sacred writings that describe Veda as a Purusha having six limbs as six Vedangas </p><p>
They are :</p><p>
- Chandhas are his two feet, <br>
-Kalpa are his two arms, <br>
-Jyotisha are his eyes, <br>
-Nirukta is his ears, <br>
-Shiksha is his nose and <br>
-Vyakarana is his mouth</p>
<p> They symbolically represent the organs of the sacred writing Purusha. so the Vedas square measure speculated to possess six limbs within the type of the six Vedangas.
</p>
<h3>
1. Shiksha:</h3><p> 
This auxiliary discipline has focussed on the letters of the Indic alphabet, accent, quantity, stress, melody and rules of phoenic combination of words throughout a religious writing recitation.</p><p> 
It intends to coach the scholars within the art and science of articulation of words and syllables in order that they will chant the religious writing hymns absolutely, manufacturing the required sound vibrations and maintain the ritual purity and effectivity of the ceremonies they perform. Shiksha very suggests that instruction, then above all „instruction in reciting „i.e., in correct pronunciation, accentuation, etc. of the Veda texts. Thus, the Shiksha-sutras square measure treatises on acoustics</p><div style=" width: 36%;float: right;"><img src="vedanga1.png" width="100%" height="350vh" ></div><p> 
-As the mother tiger carries its young fascinating it by its teeth firm, in order that cub doesn't fall, but gentle, in order that it doesn't damage, the mantras should be musical limpidly, unblurred, un-faded and not too loud. Neither ought to they be nonchalantly mouthed nor spat in several tones. The Indic language has fifty-one letters, referred to as Matruka. Maatru is that the cosmic Mother. The Siksha Sastra says that these fifty-one letters represent the assorted elements of Her body and even outline that one represents that.</p><p> The teachings of the Shiksha square measure contained within the ancient texts called Pratisakhyas, every connection to a specific Veda, providing directions for the recitation of the hymns contained in it.</p><p>
Some important Prati shakhyas are:</p><p> 
(i)  Rigveda – Prati shakhya of Rigveda. <br>
(ii) Taittiriya – Prati shakhya of Krishna Yajurveda. <br>
(iii) Vajasaneyi – Prati shakhya of Shukla Yajurveda.<br>
(iv) Atharvaveda – Pratishakhya of Atharvaveda.</p> <p> 
The Pratisakhyas was in all probability composed by several grammarians like Saunaka before grammarian and that they were revised from time to time. Shiksha vie a vital role in religious writing Asian country at a time once there was no written script and also the information of the Vedas.
</p><h3> 
2.  Kalpa:</h3><p>
 The second Vedic literature is Kalpa (a ritual that is named the arms of the sacred writing Purusha. Kalpa virtually suggests that sacred rule or law or ordinance and Sanskrit literature suggests that a thread. Sutras square measure threads of data or short statements used as memorial rules. within the absence of written communication, the sutras acted as mental hooks and helped the scholars keep in mind the intricacies of playing religious writing sacrifices and perceptive the daily rituals.</p><div style=" width: 36%;float: left;"><img src="vedanga2.png" width="100%" height="350vh" ></div>
 Kalpa deals with the practical ceremonial, sacrificial and ritual aspect of the Vedas. Technically it is the applied science of the Vedas.</p><p>
-Kalpa Sutras are usually divided into Srauta Sutras and Smartha sutras. <br>
-Srauta Sutras as prescribe rules for the performance of different types of sacrifices and rituals, the amount of fees to be paid to the priests and the type of penances to be practiced in case of violation. <br>
-The Srauta Sutras were probably composed around the 6th century BC, the same time during which some of the smartha sutras were composed. <br>
-The latter are divided into Grihya sutras and Dharma sutras. The Grihya sutras prescribe domestic rites and rituals for the three upper castes (Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaisyas), in additions to the duties and responsibilities meant for them.<br>
-The Dharmasutras are the first four texts of the Dharmasastra tradition and they focus on the idea of dharma, the principal guide by which Hindus strive to live their lives.<br>
-The Dharma sutras can be called the guide books of dharma as they contain the rules of conduct and rites as practiced in the Vedic schools.<br>
</p>
<h3 style="padding-top:15px;"> 
3. Vyakarana :</h3><p>
The third Vedanga is Vyakarana or grammar, which is necessary for the understanding of the Veda. It is called the mouth of the veda Purusha. The word, Vyakarana, is formed by prefixing “vi” and “aa” to the root “Kri”.
<div style=" width: 36%;float: right;"><img src="vedanga3.png" width="100%" height="320vh" ></div>
Vyakarana deals with Sanskrit grammar or the analysis and decomposition of words, word formation, root words and complex sentence structures, providing useful insights into the usage of words and sentences leading to the mastery of the language.
Actually The old Vedanga texts on Vyakarana are entirely lost today.</p><p>
-As we know Formation of the word is the main subject of grammar. <br>
-So It discusses root (that is - Prakriti) and suffix (that is - Pratyaya) of a word to study its meaning. Panini‟s Vyakarana is in the form of sutras or aphorisms. The fourteen sutras are referred to here, as Maheswara sutras. They were originated from Nataraja‟s damuru sound.<br>
The Ashtadhyayi contains about 4000 sutras or aphorisms divided into four parts. <br>
-Shiva sutras deal with phonetics or the accent and intonation of distinctive units of sound that form part of the word and letter sounds.<br>
-Ashtadhyayi deal with the structure of words and sentences and their construction. <br>
-Dhatupata deals with list of root words (words that give rise to other words). <br>
-Ganapatha deals with groups of nominal words (nouns or noun phrases).<br>


</p>

<h3>
4. Nirukta:</h3><p>
Nirukta Vedanga is called the ears of the veda Purusha. „Nirukta‟ means „etymology‟ and it explains the reason why a particular word has been used that is, the meaning of usage.
Nirukta is the science of etymologies. It explains the word-roots and derivation of meaning of words in different context.</p><div style=" width: 36%;float: left;"><img src="vedanga4.png" width="100%" height="320vh" ></div><p>
-The most authoritative exponent of this branch of study is Yaska, a Sanskrit grammarian and master of Sanskrit etymology, who lived before Panini. He is remembered for his monumental work called Nirukta, which is an excellent commentary of the obscure words found in the Nighantu (dictionary) of his time.</p><p>
-The Nighantus are five lists of words, which are again divided into three sections.</p><p>
-The first section consists of three lists, in which Vedic words are collected under certain main ideas. The second section contains a list of ambiguous and particularly difficult words of the Veda, while the third section gives a classification of the deities according to the three regions, earth, sky and heaven.</p><p>
-Since many Sanskrit words can be split into more than one way and the Vedas contain many obscure and unknown words, an in-depth study of Nirukta will help students discover the latent or hidden meaning of the Vedas and understand their linguistic and philosophic significance.
</p><h3>
5. Chandas :</h3><p>
Chandas is the science of metres. Chandas deals with the analysis of the types of meter used in the construction of various Vedic hymns. </p><div style=" width: 36%;float: right;"><img src="vedanga5.png" width="100%" height="320vh" ></div><p>
-In Sanskrit, the word “ Pada” is used as the metrical unit. The measurement is made depending on the number of syllables used. Syllables are classified into two categories, Guru and Laghu.</p><p>
- A string of Guru – Laghu sequence of a particular length is called a meter.<br>
-The chhandas of a mantra determines its usage, such as its purpose and context. But is acts more as an error-correcting mechanism.<br>
-So, Chhanda helps us to ensure the form of the Mantra (by meter count).<br>
-Chhanda Shastra of Pingalanaga is considered to be the oldest text available on the subject.<br>
-The knowledge of the Chhanda proved useful in the composition of the smriti literature. It also played an important role in the emergence of classical Indian music and Sanskrit poetry.<br>

</p>
<h3>
6. Jyotisha: </h3><p>
The last Vedanga Jyotisha is called eye the organ of sight, of the Veda purusha. Jyotisha deals with the astronomical and astrological aspects of fixing auspicious date and time to perform various Vedic rites and rituals including the sacraments or rites of passage.</p><p> 
-The auspicious time is usually determined based on the position of the luminous bodies (Jyotisha) namely the Sun, the Moon, the Stars and other heavenly bodies. <br>
-According to tradition, Sage Bhrigu is said to be the first person who perfected the knowledge of Jyotisha and built a record of the natal charts of every human being who was to be born earth.<br>
-According to some historians, much of our knowledge of Jyotisha came from Egypt, Persia and Greece through traders, sailors and travelers.<br>
-It is unfortunate that there is no work available at present dealing with ancient Vedic astronomy (Jyotisha) in the sutra style. Only we have a small text –book called Jyotisha of Vedic astronomy in verses in two recessions.<br><div style=" width: 38%;float: left;"><img src="vedanga6.png" width="100%" height="320vh" ></div>
-This is a very difficult text and, therefore, is not clear on several points to Scholars even today.<br>
-Also Bhaskaracharya, Varahamihira and Aryabhatta are known ancient scholars conversant with these scientific subjects.<br>
-The Jyotisha of the Vedic world played an important role in the development of Vedic calendar, in the preparation astrological charts for the purpose of performing various sacraments or rites of passage and determining the date, time and place for the performance of the sacrificial ceremonies and daily rituals.<br>
</p>
So, to a certain extent the Vedangas were responsible for the popularity of Sanskrit as the main language of communication in ancient India and for its emergence as the language of the elite.
Many principles and practices of the Vedangas were taken up by other religious traditions such as Buddhism and Jainism which relied upon Sanskrit as their medium of communication and included in their education systems and religious practices.
