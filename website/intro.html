                        Vedas</h3><p>  
Vedas are Considered the earliest literary record of Indian civilization and among the most sacred books of India. They are original scriptures of Hindu teachings, containing spiritual knowledge that hold all aspects of life. 
Vedas form the highest religious authority for all aspects of Hinduism and are a respected source of wisdom for mankind in general. 
They were written in Vedic Sanskrit between 1500 and 500 BCE in the north western region of the Indian Subcontinent in the late Bronze age. 
The laws of the Vedas have regulated the social, legal, domestic and religious customs of Hindus up to the present day. All the obligatory duties of Hindus at birth, marriage, death etc. are guided by Vedic rituals. </p><p> 
Tradition says that humans did not compose the Vedas, but it is believed that God taught the Vedic hymns to the sages, who then handed them down through generations by word of mouth.
Veda... simply means " knowledge ". It is a Sanskrit word from the root " vid " which means finding, knowing, acquiring, or understanding. The term Veda as a common noun means" knowledge ".
The word Veda means wisdom, knowledge or vision, and it serves to manifest the language of the gods in human speech. </p><p>
The Vedas were transmitted orally during the course of numerous subsequent generations before finally being archived in written form. 
The Veda's are considered one of the holiest books to the mankind for the next thousands of years.
They include elements such as liturgical material as well as mythological accounts, poems, prayers, and formulas considered to be sacred by the Vedic religion.
</p><p> 

They were carefully preserved orally as masters would have students memorize them forwards and backwards with emphasis on exact pronunciation in order to keep what was originally heard intact.
The Vedas are therefore regarded as Shruti and Smritis which means “what is heard” and “what is remembered”
Although the Veda’s are read (or) understood today, they are no doubt from the bedrock of the universal religion (or) " Sanathana Dharma " that all Hindu's follow.
The Veda’s have guided our religions direction for ages and will continue to do so for generations to come.

As we known that the humans did not compose the Vedas, but the knowledge was discovered by intense meditation. Also, the followers of the Vedic Philosophy regard the Vedas as Apaurusheya; meaning, not of a man or impersonal, and according to the Vedanta, the Vedas are considered as svatah pramana (In Sanskrit, meaning “self-evident means of knowledge”). <br> 
•The formal documentation of Vedas was done mainly by 
Vyasa Krishna Dwai-pa-ya-na around the time of Lord Krishna.</p><h3> 
 Divisions in Veda</h3><p>
Each Veda consists of four parts:<br> 
The Samhitas (hymns): They are the collection of mantras. <br>
The Brahmanas (rituals): The Brahmanas are ritualistic texts and include guidelines and religious duties. Each Veda has several Brahmanas attached to it.<br>
The Aranyakas (theologies): They consist the philosophy behind the ritual sacrifice<br>
The Upanishads (philosophies): They are religious and philosophical treatises. They consist the last phase of the Vedic revelation(Revalation).<br></p>
