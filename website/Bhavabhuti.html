    					Bhavabhuti is one of the most illustrious poets of ancient India who, according to many critics, ranks next only to Kalidasa as a great dramatist. If Bhasa or Kalidasa lived in an age when, probably, literary activity was still in its initial stages with regard to classical Sanskrit literature, by the time Bhavabhuti appeared on the literary scene, literary traditions were laid on firm foundations. Sanskrit poetics or Alankarasastra based on Bharata’s Natyasastra had been engaging the attention of many eminent writers and Dandin had contributed his famous work Kavyadarsa. Bana had become exceptionally popular and had won the proverbial appreciation BANOEEHISTAM JAGATSARVAM (All the world is left over by Bana meaning nothing is left out in Bana’s descriptions) among his critics. Harsa’s dramas had also attained, probably, enviable popularity on the stage besides getting the appreciation of critics as model works.</p><h3>
Malati-Madhava</h3><p>
 Bhavabhuti emerged at a time when critics were quite rigid in testing the worth of Kavya based on the rules of Sanskrit Dramaturgy. Bhavabhuti’s impatience to accept the onslaughts of his contemporary critics is evident in the famous stanza of Malati-Madhava. He trod his own path of poetry which earned eminence among later writers. Though his statements about himself seem to be arrogant, as many think, he exhibits great self-confidence which is evident in his plays. He says in the prologue of Malati-Madhava that he is conversant in Vyakarana, Mimamsa and Nyaya besides knowing the Vedas, Sankhya and Yoga. He was a product obviously of great Indian culture of his day born as he was, in a highly teamed Brahmin family arid imbibing all the aspects of learning he could get during his era. At some stage he must have left his native place Padmapura for Ujjaini for higher studies and to seek his fortune. </p><h3>
SANSKRIT LITERATURE</h3><p>
His mastery over Sanskrit was so high that the Gaudi style in which he wrote his plays has rare parallels in Sanskrit literature. A poet with a propensity for profundity, Bhavabhuti has seldom touched on lighter aspects of Kavya. It is therefore no surprise that he dispenses with the Vidusaka in all his plays, probably intentionally. Interestingly, both the names of the poet given by the poet himself in the introductions have given rise to the conjecture that they are not original names of the poet. </p><p>
The reference to himself as SRIKANTHAPADALANCHANAH (Having a name which signifies that goddess Saraswati dwells in his throat) is interpreted as ‘adorned with rich learning’ and BHAVABHU- TIRNAMA (called Bhavabhuti) is understood as a person having a name (or title?) BHAVABHUTI In a manuscript of Malati-Madhava, there is a reference to the author as the disciple of Kumarila at the end of the III Act and as Umbekacarya, disciple of Kumarila at the end of the VI Act. Nothing can be acceptably stated as this is a solitary reference to Umbekacarya as the author and there are no other references to this name of Bhavabhuti.</p><p> Bhavabhuti, so far as the available works in his name are concerned, has written three dramas. But there are a few interesting stanzas compiled in the anthologies, ascribed to Bhavabhuti. He also write other work besides the three dramas?It is possible that those works are not extant. Bhavabhuti seems to have lived in the earlier part of the 8th century A.D. Rajasekhara who lived about 900 A.D. calls himself the incarnation of Bhavabhuti. The famous historical work Rajatarangini states (IV — 144) that Bhavabhuti and Vakpatiraja were patronised by Yaso- varman of Kanauj.</p><p> Vakpatiraja who wrote Bandavaho mentions Adyapi while making (even now) reference to Bhavabhuti. Vakpatiraja, scholars believe, must have written his work between 733 A.D. — 753 A.D., being a junior contemporary of Bhavabhuti.</p><h3>
PLAYS</h3><p>
Of the three plays written by Bhavabhuti Mahaviracaritam is said to be the first. This play is available in eleven northern manuscripts and seven southern manuscripts. One of the manuscripts includes the sentence, SARVATHA PRACALITAHPATHAH (a text used everywhere). But interestingly Viraraghava, the commentator on Mahaviracaritam, writes that the original book consisted only upto V Act, 46th Stanza and the remaining part, viz.</p><p> the remaining part of the V Act, VI & VII Acts, were written by Subrahmanyakavi; but though the editors like Todarmall and others think that the original work had only five acts ending with the 46th Verse. Many scholars believe that the manuscript referred to earlier having all the seven acts must be the genuine work. Another manuscript of the same work got from Kashmir says that the remaining part, namely, the V — 46 onwards was completed by Vinayakabhatta.</p>
