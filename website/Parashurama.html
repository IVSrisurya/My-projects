<span style="font-size:1.4em;">P</span>arashurama , also referred to as Rama Jamadagnya, Rama Bhargava and Veerarama, is the sixth among the Dashavatara of the god Vishnu in Hinduism.
 He is believed to be one of the Chiranjeevis (long-lived ones or immortal ones), who will appear at the end of the Kali yuga to be the guru of Vishnu's tenth and last avatar, Kalki. He carried a number of traits, which included aggression, warfare and valor; also, serenity, prudence and patience.</p><p>
Born to Jamadagni and Renuka, Parashurama was foretold to seem at a time when overwhelming evil prevailed on the world . The Kshatriya class, with weapons and power, had begun to abuse their power, take what belonged to others by force and tyrannise people. Parashurama corrected the cosmic equilibrium by destroying the Kshatriya warriors twenty-one times.
 he's married to Dharani, an incarnation of Lakshmi, the wife of Vishnu. he's also the Guru of Bhishma, Dronacharya and Karna.</p><h3> 
Early Life</h3><p>
According to Hindu legends, Parashurama was born to Sage Jamadagni and his Kshatriya wife, Renuka, living during a hut. His birthplace is believed to get on top of the Janapav hills in Indore, Madhya Pradesh. On top of the hills may be a Shiva temple where Parshurama is believed to possess worshipped Lord Shiva, the ashram (abbey) is understood as Jamadagni Ashram, named after his father. The place also features a kund (pond) that's being developed by the government . that they had a celestial cow called Surabhi, which provides all they desire (Surabhi was the daughter of cow kamadhenu). A king named Kartavirya Arjuna (not to be confused with Arjuna the Pandava)– learns about it and needs it. He asks Jamadagni to offer it to him, but the sage refuses. While Parashurama is faraway from the hut, the king takes it by force. Parashurama learns about this crime, and is upset. together with his axe in his hand, he challenges the king to battle. They fight, and Parushama defeats and kills the king, consistent with the Hindu mythology. The warrior class challenges him, and he kills all his challengers. The legend likely has roots within the ancient conflict between the Brahmin varna, with knowledge duties, and therefore the Kshatriya varna, with warrior and enforcement roles.</p><p>
In some versions of the legend, after his martial exploits, Parashurama returns to his sage father with the Surabhi cow and tells him about the battles he had to fight. The sage does not congratulate Parashurama but reprimands him stating that a Brahmin should never kill a king. He asks him to expiate his sin by going on pilgrimage. After Parashurama returns from a pilgrimage, he is told that while he was away, his father was killed by Kartavirya Arjun's Sons seeking revenge. Parashurama again picks up his axe and killed them and also kills many warriors in retaliation. In the end, he relinquishes his weapons and takes up Yoga.</p><p>
In Kannada folklore, especially in devotional songs sung by the Devdasis he is often referred to as a son of Yellamma.
Parasurama legends are notable for their discussion of violence, the cycles of retaliations, the impulse of krodha (anger), the inappropriateness of krodha, and repentance.</p><h3>
Ramabhadra to Parashuram </h3><p>
Parshuram’s birth name is believed to be Rama and some Rambhadra, he is also known by the names Bhargava, Bhrigupati, Jamadagnya, Bhriguvanshi, etc. It is believed that for the destruction of sinners, he did the hard penance of Lord Shiva and got the blessings of mastering the art of warfare from him.</p><p>
He also received many unique weapons from Lord Shiva, one of them was Lord Shiva’s Parshu which is also known as Fursa or axe. He was very dear to them and always kept it together. He was called Parashurama only because of wearing a Parshu.</p>
<h3>Akshaya Tritiya and Parshuram born</h3><p>
Lord Parshuram was born on Vaishakh Shukla Tritiya. It is also considered to be the Akshaya Tritiya one of the most auspicious days of the Hindu calendar. ‘Akshay’ means ‘which never decays’, which means that it never perishes. Thakur Ji’s Charan Darshan takes place on this day in Vrindavan, Uttar Pradesh state of India.
Akshaya Tritiya is also commonly referred to as ‘Akhtij “or’ Akha Teej”. The Tritiya date of Shukla Paksha in Vaishakh month is popularly known as “Akshaya Tritiya”. Akshaya Tritiya was incarnated by Lord Vishnu as Parashurama.

Jamadagni and Renuka had a magical cow called Kaamdhenu that was the symbol of abundance. It had emerged out of the ocean during the good churning. at some point when the sage and his sons were away and Renuka was alone, a couple of Kshatriyas came to go to , Renuka offered them food and delicious milk from the cow. 
The Kshatriyas on seeing this and checking out about the cow decided to require it to king Arjuna. They asked for the cow and Renuka refused. However, while leaving, The Kshatriyas seized the cow and took it with them anyway.

Parshuram came back to his mother wailing and was very angry. He directly stormed to Mahishmati, the capital of Arjuna. Seeing him, Arjuna mocked him and told him that his father and he should only enjoys Penance and ditch Kaamdhenu as only Kshatriyas deserve the simplest of all things.</p><p> 
He sent his army to face Bhagwaan Parshuram who is the Avatar of God Vishnu and not one did survive. Arjuna was too furious to see his army destroyed. So, he went on his own to fight Parshuram.Arjuna completely forgot about the curse that was spelled upon him by Muni Vashisth after Arjuna had once burnt a forest down. The curse was meant for him to be killed by a very powerful man and he was to cut off all the thousand arms of Arjuna. The curse did turn into reality and Arjuna’s all thousand arms were cut off by Parshuram followed by his beheading.</p>
