The education system which was evolved first in ancient India is known as the Vedic System of education. In other words, the ancient system of education where based on the vedas and there for it was the given name of Vedic education system. Some scholars have subdivided vedic educational period into rigveda period, brahman period, upanishada period, sutra(hymn)period, smriti period,etc. but all these period due to pre-dominance of the vedas, there was no change in the aims and an ideals for education. The education system of Vedic period has unique characteristics and qualities which were not found in the ancients education system of any other country of the world. In the words of Dr.P.N. Prabha, “ Education in ancient India was free from any external control like that of the state and government or any party polities. It was the king‟s duties to see that learned pundits, pursued their studies and performed their duty of imparting knowledge without interference from any source what show ever”</p><h3>

AIMS OF VEDIC EDUCATION SYSTEM</h3><p>
Vedic Education was taught to students to achieve high ideals of life. The Vedic period sees education as a source of light and salvation. The aims of Vedic Education of ancient India were as follows</p><h4>
Self-realization</h4><p>
One of the most vital aims of Vedic Education is self-realization. Realization means knowledge and experience. It starts with knowing the self. Self does not mean only an individual self. Instead, it is the supreme self.</p><h4>
Development of Healthy Physique</h4><p>
The Vedic education system also aims to develop a healthy physique. It gives importance to health because only a healthy student could control his senses and preserve sex-energy.</p><h4>
Education for Character Building</h4><p>
Character building was another aim of Vedic Education. Student life was considered as a life of Tapasya or Meditation. A student, being a Brahmacharya has to develop virtues like morality, brahmacharya (celibacy) sacrifice, simplicity, honesty, service, dutifulness, modesty, freedom from conceit. Also, a student should give up bad habits like an indulgence, selfishness, luxury, enjoyment, pleasure, etc. He had to develop purity of character.</p><h4>
All Round Development of Personality</h4><p>
One of the chief aims of Vedic education was all-round development of personality. Also, it aims to develop the physical, mental, emotional, social, moral and spiritual aspects of humans.</p><h4>
Fulfillment of Social Responsibility</h4><p>
Another major aim of Vedic Education was to fulfill social duties.</p><h4>
Emphasis on Co-operation</h4><p>
Vedic education also gave importance to co-operation. Education in the Vedic age did not only take a note on the body, mind, and soul of the student. Also, it incorporates activities that bind him to his fellows to constitute society.</p><h4>
Emphasis upon Knowledge and Experience</h4><p>
Vedic Education in Gurukulas gives importance to knowledge and to obtain experience.</p><h4>
Sublimation of Instinct</h4><p>
Another aim of Vedic education is to change the students thinking from material knowledge and make the students focus on the spiritual world.
Some scholars say that the aims of Vedic education are Religious Preaching, Knowledge of Literature, Removal of Ignorance, Brahman Realisation, and Spiritual Knowledge, etc.</p><h4>
AIMS AND FUNCTIONS OF VEDIC EDUCATION</h4><p>
The aims and functions of Vedic Education System are as follows:</p><p>
Infusion of Spirit of Piety and Religiousness
Another aim of Vedic education was to recognize Vedic religion and to infuse piety to others through various instincts. The prime aim of human life is to achieve spiritual values, i.e. truth, beauty, and goodness. The realization of these values is the realization of self.</p><p>
In this way, man rises higher and higher in the mortal plane until he attains Divinity. Hence, education aims to develop the capacities of knowing, feeling and willing in man to the full extent so that he can achieve the highest spiritual values and thus he can receive true and ultimate self.</p><h4>
Release from Illusion</h4><p>
Since this material world is unreal, illusory and full of fetters, according to Vedanta philosophers the highest wisdom lay in the release from the unreality, illusion, and fetters. They could run away from this material world, so preparing for a living was one of the aims of education.</p><h4>
Development of Perfect Personality</h4><p>
Vedic education greatly gives importance to the personality of students. Various traits of personality were developed through the following methods:</p><p>
1.Self-Respect: A feeling of self-respect should be developed in the students through education. The student feels that he was the torch-bearer of the culture of the race. A well-educated youth was to be honored to develop a sense of self-respect in students.<br>
2.Self-Confidence: Self-confidence was instilled into the mind of students right from the start of education when the Unpanayan ritual was observed to admit them in Gurukuls.<br>
3.Self-Restraint: The very simple life of a student at the Ashrams created self-restraint in them. Self-restrain helps to improve their personality.<br>
4.Discrimination and Judgement: Vedic education developed the power of discrimination and judgment in the students to enrich their personality.</p><h4>
Inculcation of Civic and Social Duties</h4><p>
The aim of education during the Vedic age was to make the students realize their civic and social duties. Thus, students were trained to lead a social life and not to be self-centered. Also, they were taught to co-operate with others and to perform their duties as a son, as a husband, father, neighbor, as a friend, and as other relatives and citizens of the state efficiently and consciously was a must for the students. Also, the teacher teaches the students about their duties towards their family, their village, their society, and their country. Teachers teach the students to serve the guests, the poor, the suffering and the down-trodden.</p><h3>
Promotion of Social Efficiency and Welfare</h3><p>
The Promotion of Social Efficiency and welfare was also one of the aims of education during the Vedic period. The teacher teaches the students not only to improve the mental, cultural, physical, and spiritual aspects of life. But teaches them vocational training. The students were expected to adopt their parental vocations for earning their livelihood. There was the provision in the education of that time that when students leave the Gurukulas after the students complete their education they should be able to earn to support their families. Thus, each family trained its children in the vocation which the family follows generation after generation. The purpose was to make each individual socially efficient.</p><h4>
Character Formation</h4><p>
The Vedic period views Education as a means to impart moral values. So, the teachers teach the students moral values like respecting elders, to be honest, loyal, worthy, etc. The very atmosphere of Ashrams and Gurukulas where students stay under the direct guidance of gurus was full of high morality. Students strictly follow the rules and regulations. In everyday life, students have to follow the rules of etiquette and good manners towards their seniors, equals and juniors, their teacher and other members of Gurukulas and Ashrams. The rituals and daily prayers helped in forming their character.</p><h4>
Preservation and Spread of Culture</h4><p>
Last but not the least important aim of education of the Vedic Age was to preserve and spread of national culture and heritage. The students have to memorize the Vedic literature so that they can preserve and spread it on to the next generation.</p><h3>
METHODS OF TEACHING DURING VEDIC PERIOD</h3><h4>
Oral Teaching</h4><p>
Due to a lack of printing and writing material, especially paper, the books were handwritten. During the Vedic period, there were very fewer books, so teaching was mainly on oral. The teacher teaches the lessons to the students by word of mouth. The students listened to the teacher with attention and devotion and committed the texts by heart.</p><p>This oral teaching method takes place at three stages:</p><p>
1.Shravan or listening to the teacher<br>
2.Manan or Meditation and<br>
3.Nididdyasan or realization through meditation.</p><h4>
The Question-Answer Method</h4><p>
During the Vedic period, the questions-answer method and discussion were common. The Pupil asked questions and Guru then explains. Through this method, the students have to learn their subjects.</p><h4>
Agra-Shishya or Pupil-Teacher System</h4><p>
It was normal practice in Ashrams and Gurukulas that intelligent senior pupil was deputed by the Gurus to teach junior students. This system helped both the pupil-teacher and the students and also gave relief to Guru.</p><p>
Use of Illustration, Examples, Sutras, Stories, Maxims, etc.
This system was based on psychological principles. To explain things better, the Guru uses illustrations, examples, stories, maxims, etc. He proceeded from known to unknown and from unknown to known. He also explained things through figures of speech like similes, metaphors, etc.</p><h3>

PROCESS OF VEDIC SYSTEM OF EDUCATION</h3><p>
The process of the Vedic System of Education was fixed and standardized based on certain universally admitted and established ideas and practices of the Vedic society. Though the subjects and courses of study vary in different periods, and systems of education, but its methods of training and discipline remain the same under all conditions.
The admission of a student starts with Upanayana. After the admission, when the student chooses the teacher, it is called Acharya. Gurukula is the center of learning. The Upanayana ceremony was performed for 3 days.</p><p>
After this ceremony, the student emerges as a Brahmacharya. It is new and changed individual both externally and internally. The home of the teacher was the center of learning in the Vedic period. It was located in natural surroundings.
The teacher teaches each individual with their differences. The Guru acts as the super-ego or conscience and inculcates in the minds of the students the high ideals of morality and spirituality.</p><p>
It was the usual rule for the Brahmachari to go about begging alms for his teacher and the Gurukula. Begging had certain educative value. It produced in the pupils a spirit of humanity and renunciation. Till the attainment of knowledge, the student had to live in the Gurukula. During his stay in the Gurukul, the students need to perform all the duties necessary for its maintenance. For example, cleaning, caring for animals, fetching water, building houses, etc.</p><p>
These trainings provide the students with an opportunity for outdoor life and physical exercise, which was more fruitful in every way than modern barren games of football, hockey, and cricket. Thus education was not only based on theory and academics but was related to work experience as well.
In the process of education in the Gurukula, the student has to go to the forest, cut and collect fuel and fetch it to the Gurukula for tending the sacred fire. Worship Agni by the offering of choice objects had spiritual and cultural significance. The Agnihotra ceremony was performed in the Gurukula to enable the pupils to understand the reality of religion in the form of sacrifice.</p><p>
The students follow rules such as early rising, prayer, bath, dress, food, sleep, celibacy, etc. The age at which a student begins his education varied from time to time.
The Vedic period considers the age from the time of birth to 5 years as a playtime. Hereafter, students study Vedic education.</p><h3>
THE CURRICULUM OF VEDIC EDUCATION</h3><p>
The curriculum of the Vedic education system can be discussed as the lower stage and upper stage of education.</p><p>
At the lower stage, the children after learning the letters of the alphabet at home they were sent at school to Shabda-Vidya (learning of words). It means phonology and implies mainly grammar. Then the children learn elementary philosophy, elementary grammar, elementary arithmetic, and elementary prosody. Besides the study of language, literature, and grammar, the students had to study the Hetuvidya or Logic, which develops the reasoning faculty and Shilpa Vidya or Science of Arts, and crafts.</p><p>
At the upper stage, the subjects taught fell into two categories:</p><h4>
Para-Vidya or Spiritual Learning.</h4><p>
Into this category, it falls the essential study of the four Vedas viz. Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samveda, and Atharvaveda. Also, this category includes the study of Vedangas, Upanishad, Puran, Pitrya (the rules for the sacrifices for the ancestors) Vakovakya (logic), Ekayana (ethics), the Devavidya (etymology), the Brahmavidya (pronunciation) Siksha (the ceremonial), etc. To achieve salvation restriction of mental disposition was essential. So the training of Yoga was also introduced.</p><h4>
Apara-Vidya or Worldly Learning</h4><p>
This included subjects like History, Ayurveda, Economics, Astrology, Physics, Zoology, Geology, Chemistry, Serpent Science, Surgery, Kalpa Vidya. Also, it includes the Rashi (the science of number), Bhut Vidya (the science of Demons). Along with the theoretical aspect of the curriculum, the practical also holds a due place and importance.</p><h3>
ORGANIZATION OF EDUCATION</h4><p>
The organization of Vedic Education System are below:</p><h4>
Courses of Study</h4><p>
In the Vedic Education System, the course does not only concentrate on religion. Disciples are also taught as subjects that enable the realization of self.</p><h3>
Education for all</h3><p>
Vedic education was free to everyone. Every caste and creed can join Vedic education.
Brahman Sangh provides chances to meritorious students to seek higher knowledge. These Sanghas are similar to the seminars of modern times because they had all the traits of modern seminars.
</p><h4>System of Admission during Vedic Period in India</h4><p>
The system of education which was prevalent was altogether different from the present system of education. Student life in Vedic education began with upanayana, when the student goes to his chosen teacher called Acharya.</p><p>
The place of learning was called Gurukula. The ceremony was performed for three days. After the ceremony of upanayana the pupil emerges as a dwija or twice born. This upanayana ceremony, unfolds his mind and soul. After this ceremony, the pupil was called as a Brahmachari, a new and changed individual, both internally and externally, from which he began his student life.</p><p>
Learning was almost monopolized by the Brahmins. As time passed on, the other two castes, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas, were also entitled to receive education. But the Sudras in general were denied to study the Holy Scriptures.
The home of the teacher or Guru was the centre of learning in Vedic period which was situated in natural surroundings, not artificially constituted. It was functioning in solitude and silence. The age limit for upanayan ceremony was eight years, eleven years and twelve years, respectively for Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas.</p>

<h4>
Vedic Period in India and Methods of Teaching:</h4><p>
There were mainly three steps of learning according to Vedic system. Sravana, the first step meant listening towards the texts as uttered by the teacher. By this method of education, knowledge was conserved and transmitted to the oncoming generation. The second step was Manana i.e. to internalize or to assimilate what was given to the pupil.
It is a process of deliberation and reflection on the topic. The third step was Nididhyasana (Meditation) by which truth is realised and attained. It was considered indispensable for the realization of the Supreme Reality.</p><p>
The ancient system of teaching was listening (Shruti). Perception was the direct method of learning. Lecture, dialogue, debate, discussion, question-answer, sight¬seeing etc. were adopted as the methods of teaching. On the whole both intuitive and empirical methods, both Yogic and Scientific methods were adopted for acquisition of knowledge and skills.</p><h3>
WOMEN EDUCATION</h3><p>
The status and condition of women and girls were much better in Vedic period than any other subsequent period. If any women wanted to pursue education and knowledge and that too without getting married, they were allowed to do so without any bindings and constraints. Most of the girls from well to do families also had the privilege to acquire education. The Upanayana (initiation ceremony) were organized for both the girls and boys. During the Aryan period which is also called poetical period, it can be rightly said that the education of women were not being neglected. They never showed prejudice against women education and were concerned about the righteousness of the social order of the women. Through the Vedas, it is clearly comes to the notice that the whole Aryan race collectively were very conscious in terms of promulgating codes and laws and uplifting the conditions of women. It greatly contributed to the collective creative forces of the general mass. Aryans were mainly not aware or conscious about the gender power politics and conflicts at their time because at that time society was not complex and it was in developing stage. The Vedic period has witnessed many women scholars and they were well-versed in sacred texts and Vedas. These women not only composed hymns but they also learnt music and dancing. The women who belonged to the lower strata or caste learnt spinning, weaving and needle work. The educators of Vedic period had wisely divided women into 2(two) groups namely- Brahmavadinis and Sadyodvahas. Brahmavadinis were the life-long students of philosophy and theology.</p><p> 
Sadyodvahas used to prosecute their studies until they got married at the age of 15-16 years. Many educated women became teachers or Upadhyayinis. There were many women poets and philosophers in Vedic period. The Vedic age has witnessed many capable and sagacious women like Apala, Ghosha and Visvavara, who used to compose mantras and were said to be rose to the rank of rishis or sages. Lopamudra, one of the female preachers of Vedic period, is believed to have preached as many as 179 hymns of the first book of the Rig Veda along with sage Agasthya. Therefore, it can be said that women were given equal opportunities in education along with the male ones to prove their capability and intelligence whether in the field of education or in any social customs and rituals.
 In pre-Vedic times also, women used to take part in religious activities and sacrifices along with their husbands. When formal education was given to the girls and women, they were required to utter ‘Mantras’ or verses so that it could help them to recite verses with very clarity and with correctness.</p><p> Many women scholars of the Vedic period overcame many social constraints. In Vedic period, they were as equal as man in education and had surpassed men in their scholarly fields also. Apala, Atreyiand Ghosha are some of the renowned scholars of this period. In richer families in this period, special teachers were mainly employed to teach various arts like toilet ointments, dancing, music, garland-making, painting, patching, sewing, magic, composing poems and preparation of toys along with other arts. In some learned persons houses also, young girls could learn the lessons just by listening which were being taught to the young students. Therefore, we can say that there was a greater authority and honor in the position of the women in the Vedic society. They along with their husbands participated in social sacrifices, domestic ceremonies and feasts. Thus, social morality was of comparatively high standard and social relations were maintained with mutual spirit and cordiality.</p>
<h3>
CONCLUSION</h3><p>
In Vedic era education had the prominent place in society. It was considered as pious and important for society. Education was must for everybody for becoming cultured. Relationship between Guru and pupils were very cordial during vedic and post- vedic period. By means of education efforts were being made to infuse ―Satyam Shivam and Sundaram‖ inside the students. A great importance was attached to veda in education system, self study Swadhyaya was considered more important during that period. The vedic period favoured women education.</p><p>
The ancient Indian education system was successful in preserving end spreading its culture and literature even without the help of art of writing. It was only because of the destruction of temples and monasteries by invaders that the literature was lost. The cultural unity that exists even today in the vast sub-continent is due to successful preservation & spread of culture. The education system infused a sense of responsibilities and social values. The ancient education system achieved its aims to the fullest extent.
</p><p>
 Ancient education emerged from Vedas. The basis of Indian culture lies in the Vedas.
