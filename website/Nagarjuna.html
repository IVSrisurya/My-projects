<span style="font-size:1.4em;">N</span>āgārjuna (c. 150 – c. 250 CE) was an Indian Mahāyāna Buddhist thinker, scholar-saint and philosopher. He is widely considered as one of the most important Buddhist philosophers. Furthermore, according to Jan Westerhoff, he is also "one of the greatest thinkers in the history of Asian philosophy."</p><p> 
Nāgārjuna is widely considered to be the founding father of the madhyamaka (centrism, middle-way) school of Buddhist philosophy and a defender of the Mahāyāna movement. His Mūlamadhyamakakārikā (Root Verses on Madhyamaka, MMK) is that the most vital text on the madhyamaka philosophy of emptiness. The MMK inspired an outsized number of commentaries in Sanskrit, Chinese, Tibetan, Korean and Japanese and continues to be studied today.</p><h3> 
Background</h3><p>
India within the 1st and 2nd centuries CE was divided into various states, including the Kushan Empire and therefore the Satavahana Kingdom. At now in Buddhist history, the Buddhist community was already divided into various Buddhist schools and had spread throughout India.
At this point , there was already alittle and nascent Mahāyāna movement. Mahāyāna ideas were held by a minority of Buddhists in India at the time. As Joseph Walser writes, "Mahāyāna before the fifth century was largely invisible and doubtless existed only as a minority and largely unrecognized movement within the fold of nikāya Buddhism." By the second century, early Mahāyāna Sūtras like the Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā were already circulating among certain Mahāyāna circles.</p><h3> 
Life</h3><p>
Very little is reliably known of the lifetime of Nāgārjuna and modern historians don't agree on a selected date (1st to 3rd century CE) or place (multiple places in India suggested) for him. The earliest surviving accounts were written in Chinese and Tibetan centuries after his death and are mostly hagiographical accounts that are historically unverifiable. 
Some scholars like Joseph Walser argue that Nāgārjuna was an advisor to a king of the Sātavāhana dynasty which ruled the Deccan Plateau within the second century. this is often supported by most of the normal hagiographical sources also .[11] Archaeological evidence at Amarāvatī indicates that if this is often true, the king may are Yajña Śrī Śātakarṇi (c. last half of the 2nd century). On the idea of this association, Nāgārjuna is conventionally placed at around 150–250 CE.</p><p> 
Walser thinks that it's presumably that when Nāgārjuna wrote the Ratnavali, he lived during a mixed monastery (with Mahāyānists and non-Mahāyānists) during which Mahāyānists were the minority. the foremost likely sectarian affiliation of the monastery consistent with Walser was Purvasailya, Aparasailya, or Caityaka (which were Mahāsāṃghika sub-schools).</p><p> 
He also argues that "it is plausible that he wrote the Ratnavali within a thirty-year period at the top of the second century within the Andhra region around Dhanyakataka (modern-day Amaravati)." </p><h3>
Traditional hagiography</h3><p>
According to Walser, "the earliest extant legends about Nāgārjuna are compiled into Kumārajīva’s biography of Nāgārjuna, which he translated into Chinese in about 405 c.e." consistent with this biography, Nāgārjuna was born into a Brahmin family in Vidarbha (a region of Maharashtra) and later became a Buddhist. the normal religious hagiographies place Nāgārjuna in various regions of India (Kumārajīva and Candrakirti place him in South India, Xuanzang in south Kosala).</p><p> 
Traditional religious hagiographies credit Nāgārjuna with being related to the teaching of the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras also like having revealed these scriptures to the planet after that they had remained hidden for a few time. The sources differ on where this happened and the way Nāgārjuna retrieved the sutras. Some sources say he retrieved the sutras from the land of the nāgas. </p><p>
Indeed, Nāgārjuna is usually depicted in composite form comprising human and nāga characteristics. Nāgas are snake-like supernatural beings of great magical ability that feature in Hindu, Buddhist and Jain mythology. Nāgas are found throughout Indian religious culture, and typically signifies an intelligent serpent or dragon, who is liable for the rains, lakes and other bodies of water. In Buddhism, it's a synonym for a realised arhat, or adviser generally . </p><p>
Traditional sources also claim that Nāgārjuna practiced aryuvedic alchemy (rasayāna). Kumārajīva's biography for instance , has Nāgārjuna making an elixir of invisibility, and Bus-ton, Taranatha and Xuanzang all state that he could turn rocks into gold. </p><p>
Tibetan hagiographies also state that Nāgārjuna studied at Nālanda University. However, consistent with Walser, this university wasn't a robust monastic center until about 425. Also, as Walser notes, "Xuanzang and Yijing both spent considerable time at Nālanda and studied Nāgārjuna’s texts there. it's strange that they might have spent such a lot time there and yet chose to not report any local tales of a person whose works played such a crucial part within the curriculum." </p><p>
Some sources (Bu-ston and therefore the other Tibetan historians) claim that in his later years, Nāgārjuna lived on the mountain of Śrīparvata near the town that might later be called Nāgārjunakoṇḍa ("Hill of Nāgārjuna"). The ruins of Nāgārjunakoṇḍa are located in Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh . The Caitika and Bahuśrutīya nikāyas are known to possess had monasteries in Nāgārjunakoṇḍa. The archaeological finds at Nāgārjunakoṇḍa haven't resulted in any evidence that the location was related to Nagarjuna.</p><p> The name "Nāgārjunakoṇḍa" dates from the medieval period, and the 3rd-4th century inscriptions found at the site make it clear that it was known as "Vijayapuri" in the ancient period.</p><h3> 
Works</h3><p>
There exist a number of influential texts attributed to Nāgārjuna though, as there are many pseudepigrapha attributed to him, lively controversy exists over which are his authentic works.</p><h4>
Mūlamadhyamakakārikā</h4><p>
The Mūlamadhyamakakārikā is Nāgārjuna's best-known work. it's "not only a grand commentary on the Buddha's discourse to Kaccayana, the sole discourse cited by name, but also an in depth and careful analysis of most of the important discourses included within the Nikayas and therefore the Agamas, especially those of the Atthakavagga of the Sutta-nipata. 
Utilizing the Buddha's theory of "dependent arising" (pratitya-samutpada), Nagarjuna demonstrated the futility of metaphysical speculations. His method of handling such metaphysics is mentioned as "middle way" (madhyama pratipad). it's the center way that avoided the substantialism of the Sarvastivadins also because the nominalism of the Sautrantikas. </p><p>
In the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā, "All experienced phenomena are empty (sunya). This didn't mean that they're not experienced and, therefore, non-existent; only that they're barren of a permanent and eternal substance (svabhava) because, sort of a dream, they're mere projections of human consciousness. Since these imaginary fictions are experienced, they're not mere names (prajnapti)."</p><h3> 
Major attributed works</h3><p>
According to David Seyfort Ruegg, the Madhyamakasastrastuti attributed to Candrakirti (c. 600 – c. 650) refers to eight texts by Nagarjuna:
the (Madhyamaka)karikas, the Yuktisastika, the Sunyatasaptati, the Vigrahavyavartani, the Vidala (i.e. Vaidalyasutra/Vaidalyaprakarana), the Ratnavali, the Sutrasamuccaya, and Samstutis (Hymns). This list covers not only much but the grand total of works ascribed to Nagarjuna within the Chinese and Tibetan collections, but it doesn't even include all such works that Candrakirti has himself cited in his writings. 
According to one view, that of Christian Lindtner, the works definitely written by Nāgārjuna are:</p><p>
•Mūlamadhyamaka-kārikā (Fundamental Verses of the Middle Way), available in three Sanskrit manuscripts and numerous translations. </p><p>
•Śūnyatāsaptati (Seventy Verses on Emptiness), amid a prose commentary ascribed to Nagarjuna himself.
•Vigrahavyāvartanī (The End of Disputes)</p><p>
•Vaidalyaprakaraṇa (Pulverizing the Categories), a prose work critiquing the categories employed by Indian Nyaya philosophy.</p><p>
•Vyavahārasiddhi (Proof of Convention)</p><p>
•Yuktiṣāṣṭika (Sixty Verses on Reasoning)</p><p>
•Catuḥstava (Four Hymns): Lokātīta-stava (Hymn to transcendence), Niraupamya-stava (to the Peerless), Acintya-stava (to the Inconceivable), and Paramārtha-stava (to Ultimate Truth). </p><p>
•Ratnāvalī (Precious Garland), subtitled (rajaparikatha), a discourse addressed to an Indian king (possibly a Satavahana monarch).</p><p> 
•Pratītyasamutpādahṝdayakārika (Verses on the guts of Dependent Arising), along side a brief commentary (Vyākhyāna).</p><p>
•Sūtrasamuccaya, an anthology of varied sutra passages.</p><p>
•Bodhicittavivaraṇa (Exposition of the awakening mind)</p><p>
•Suhṛllekha (Letter to an honest Friend)</p><p>
•Bodhisaṃbhāraśāstra (Requisites of awakening), a piece the trail of the Bodhisattva and paramitas, it's quoted by Candrakirti in his commentary on Aryadeva's four hundred. Now only extant in Chinese translation (Taisho 1660).</p><P> 
The Tibetan historian Buston considers the primary six to be the most treatises of Nāgārjuna (this is named the "yukti corpus", rigs chogs), while consistent with Tāranātha only the primary five are the works of Nāgārjuna. TRV Murti considers Ratnaavali, Pratitya Samutpaada Hridaya and Sutra Samuccaya to be works of Nāgārjuna because the first two are quoted profusely by Chandrakirti and therefore the third by Shantideva. <p><h3>
Other attributed works</h3><p>
In addition to works mentioned above, several others are attributed to Nāgārjuna. There is an ongoing, lively controversy over which of those works are authentic. Contemporary research suggest that some these works belong to a significantly later period, either to late 8th or early 9th century CE, and hence can not be authentic works of Nāgārjuna. Several works considered important in esoteric Buddhism are attributed to Nāgārjuna and his disciples by traditional historians like Tāranātha from 17th century Tibet. These historians try to account for chronological difficulties with various theories. For example, apropagation of later writings via mystical revelation. For a useful summary of this tradition, see Wedemeyer 2007.</p><p>
According to Ruegg, "three collections of stanzas on the virtues of intelligence and moral conduct ascribed to Nagarjuna are extant in Tibetan translation": Prajñasatakaprakarana, Nitisastra-Jantuposanabindu and Niti-sastra-Prajñadanda.</p><div style=" width: 40%;float: right;"><img src="nag1.png" width="100%" height="50%" ></div><p> 
Other works are extant only in Chinese, one of these is the Shih-erh-men-lun or 'Twelve-topic treatise' (*Dvadasanikaya or *Dvadasamukha-sastra); one of the three basic treatises of the Sanlun school (East Asian Madhyamaka). </p><p>
Lindtner considers that the Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa (Ta-chih-tu-lun, Taisho 1509, "Commentary on the great prajñaparamita") which has been influential in Chinese Buddhism, is not a genuine work of Nāgārjuna. This work is also only attested in a Chinese translation by Kumārajīva and is unknown in the Tibetan and Indian traditions. There is much discussion as to whether this is a work of Nāgārjuna, or someone else. Étienne Lamotte, who translated one third of the work into French, felt that it was the work of a North Indian bhikṣu of the Sarvāstivāda school who later became a convert to the Mahayana. The Chinese scholar-monk Yin Shun felt that it was the work of a South Indian and that Nāgārjuna was quite possibly the author. These two views are not necessarily in opposition and a South Indian Nāgārjuna could well have studied the northern Sarvāstivāda. Neither of the two felt that it was composed by Kumārajīva, which others have suggested.</p><h3>
Other attributed works include: </h3><p>
•Bhavasamkranti</p><p>
•Dharmadhatustava (Hymn to the Dharmadhatu), uncertain authorship, according to Ruegg, it shows traces of later Mahayana and Tantrik thought.</p><p>
•Salistambakarikas</p><p>
•A commentary on the Dashabhumikasutra.</p><p>
•Mahayanavimsika (uncertain authorship as per Ruegg)</p><p>
•*Ekaslokasastra (Taisho 1573)</p><p>
•*Isvarakartrtvanirakrtih (A refutation of God/Isvara)</p><p>
Philosophy</p><p>
 Hinduism</p><p>
Nāgārjuna was fully acquainted with the classical Hindu philosophies of Samkhya and even the Vaiseshika. Nāgārjuna assumes a knowledge of the definitions of the sixteen categories as given in the Nyaya Sutras, the chief text of the Hindu Nyaya school, and wrote a treatise on the pramanas where he reduced the syllogism of five members into one of three. In the Vigrahavyavartani Karika, Nāgārjuna criticises the Nyaya theory of pramanas (means of knowledge)  </p><h3>
 Mahāyānaism</h3><p>
Nāgārjuna was conversant with many of the Śrāvaka philosophies and with the Mahāyāna tradition; however, determining Nāgārjuna's affiliation with a selected nikāya is difficult, considering much of this material has been lost. If the foremost commonly accepted attribution of texts (that of Christian Lindtner) holds, then he was clearly a Māhayānist, but his philosophy holds assiduously to the Śrāvaka Tripiṭaka, and while he does make explicit references to Mahāyāna texts, he's always careful to remain within the parameters began by the Śrāvaka canon.</p><p>
Nāgārjuna may have received his positions from a desire to realize a uniform exegesis of the Buddha's doctrine as recorded within the āgamas. within the eyes of Nāgārjuna, Buddha wasn't merely a forerunner, but the very founding father of the Madhyamaka system. David Kalupahana sees Nāgārjuna as a successor to Moggaliputta-Tissa in being a champion of the middle-way and a reviver of the first philosophical ideals of Buddha .</p><h3> 
 Pyrrhonism</h3><p>
Because of the high degree of similarity between Nāgārjuna's philosophy and Pyrrhonism, particularly the surviving works of Sextus Empiricus, Thomas McEvilley suspects that Nāgārjuna was influenced by Greek Pyrrhonist texts imported into India. Pyrrho of Elis (c. 360-c. 270 BCE), the founding father of this school of sceptical philosophy, was himself influenced by Indian philosophy. Pyrrho traveled to India with Alexander the Great's army and studied with the gymnosophists. consistent with Christopher I. Beckwith, Pyrrho's teachings are supported Buddhism, because the Greek terms adiaphora, astathmēta and anepikrita within the Aristocles Passage resemble the Buddhist three marks of existence. consistent with him, the key innovative tenets of Pyrrho's scepticism were only found in Indian philosophy at the time and not in Greece. </p>
