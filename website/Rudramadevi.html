<h3>BIRTH AND GROWTH</h3><p>
Rudrama Devi was born as Rudramba to King Ganapathideva. She was the sole child of the King Ganapathideva, who was the ruler of the Kakateeya Dynasty. He ruled the whole territory from Warangal the capital of the Dynasty.</p><p>
The Kakatiya Dynasty was one among the main dynasties that ruled over Telangana and had major contributions in shaping its history and civilisation. Hanumankonda, a hillock lying in between the rivers Godavari and Krishna, formed the inspiration of the Kakateeya Empire. Warangal, which was then called Orugallu, formed the capital of the Dynasty which ruled over the Telugu country from about 1150 AD to 1323 AD.
 </p><p>
Since Ganapathideva had no sons, he performed the Putrika ceremony and formally designated Rudrama Devi as a son. For her male recognition, she was named Rudradeva. On the recommendation of the Prime Minister, Ganapathideva also nominated Rudramadevi to be his ‘male heir’. 
She rose to power in her early teens when she was appointed co-regent and ruled alongside her father. She maintained the designation that was bestowed on her and ruled as a King. She wore male attire and maintained an identical demeanour. She was later married to Veerabhadra, prince of Nidadavolu with whom she had two female children. </p><h3>
PANDYAN INVASION</h3><p>
In the first few years of the conjoined rule together with her father, Rudramadevi saw the dominion falling into utter chaos during the Pandya invasion. Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan I invaded their empire throwing it into disorder and confusion. The Kakateeyas along side their allies were disastrously defeated on the battlefield of Muttukur near Nelore. Although the invasion was eventually repelled and Ganapathi could ultimately turn back the tide of the invasion, he suffered the loss of territory and respect. Consequently, his control over feudatories and nobles were left in shaking grounds. the dominion was now left during a weakened state.</p><p>
Following the loss of prestige after the Pandya invasion, her father retired from the general public sphere passing on the control to Rudrama. The powers now were vested within the hands of Rani Rudrama Devi. Scriptures suggest, she individually started ruling from 1261. 
Around 1266 she lost both her father and her husband. After the demise of her father, Rudrama was finally coronated in 1269. She was now officially the Queen of the Empire. However, due to her gender, several oppositions including that of her stepbrothers came her way. Harihara Dev and Murari Dev who refused to undergo a woman’s authority later rebelled against her.
</p><h3>
REGIME</h3><p>
Despite the antagonism she faced due to her gender, she rose up together of the best warriors of her time. She drove back the Yedava King of Devagiri forcing him to finally sign a peace accord. She also introduced a replacement policy of recruiting people from the non-aristocratic background as commanders within the army also because the administration. it had been a radical step to require at that point . it's believed that she suggests such a policy to realize the trust of the commoners and thereby win new loyalists. </p><p>
She also captured important forts like Renadu, Eruva Mulikinadu, and Satti.
Her accomplishments include the completion of the Warangal fort that her father had begun. It involved the addition of a second wall and a moat to the structure which was built to guard the town against future sieges.</p><p>
History believes Rudrama Devi was one among the foremost outstanding queens of all times in Indian history. She played a lively part in governing the country and maintained the simplest interest of her people. Despite the interruptions from neighbouring empires, her people remained contended under her rule. While her gender was no barrier for her, she faced the ill will of others due to her gender.</p><h3>
GLORY FROM OTHER LANDS</h3><p>
The Venetian traveller Polo on his visit to the dominion later spoke of her administrative qualities in high capacity. He appreciated her benign rule and greatness. He described her as a woman of discretion and appreciated her manners of justice and equity.
Through the annals of history, gender has time and again proven to be an ‘impediment’ and a tool of suppression. The thirteenth-century witnessed the increase of two such legendary queens who were downtrodden against their gender.</p><p> 
Razia Sultana, daughter of Iltutmish ascended the throne of the Delhi Sultanate in 1236 CE. during a sphere that was dominated by men, queens like Razia and Rudrama Devi fought their thanks to ultimately rule their kingdoms. However, the century may be a testament to a sadder reality of suppression of those women despite being within the highest echelon. Razia’s reign lasted for four years. Minhaj-i Siraj writes that “She was endowed with all the admirable attributes and qualifications necessary for Kings. But her sex was her greatest disqualification.”</p><p>
At a time when purdah formed the larger a part of the Mughal customs and attire, Razia rose against the practice deeming it obstructive. Razia too discarded conventional female attire and wearing qaba and kulah which were elements of dresses worm by men. 
Attire and appearance become a standard denominator in both these examples. Through the vicissitudes of history, the necessity for ladies to endow themselves with conventionally masculine traits and project themselves as men is diagnostic a bigger contradiction.
