The ever undefeated King of Kashmir who tasted victory everywhere he went; even the Chinese, the Turkish and therefore the Tibetan legends mentioned him as an excellent conqueror; the primary Indian king who gave a befitting reply to the invading Arabs; one among the few Indian kings who was ready to capture Central Asia; the Kashmiri King whose influence spread even to the South India and played a crucial role within the foundation of the Rashtrakuta empire there, which became one among the foremost powerful kingdoms to possess ever existed in South India; the king who blasted the parable that Indians were never ready to capture any foreign lands.<p><h3> 
ALEXANDER OF INDIA</h3><p>
This great son of India who hailed from Kashmir was none aside from Lalitaditya Muktapida of Karkota dynasty, the mightiest Indian king of his times and beyond. Believed to be the youngest of the three sons of Kashmiri king Durlabhaka (alias Pratapaditya), Lalitaditya ascended the throne in 724 AD at a time when Karkota dynasty ruled this day Jammu & Kashmir, Punjab and Haryana. Lalitaditya not only stopped the Arabs from entering India but also conquered parts of Iran and extended his Kingdom upto Tibet and China. His successful efforts to guard Kashmir and India are some things which the Indian nation can and will always remember . But it's really sad that the story of this greatest of Kings remains virtually dead and finds no place in history books of faculties and colleges even within the post- independent India.

<h3>
INVASIONS ON FOREIGN LANDS
</h3><p>
Very early in his youth the good warrior king had understood that Kashmir was facing two enemies at an equivalent time; one was the Arab caliphate which had captured Sindh after defeating Raja Dahir and therefore the other was the Tibetan empire. it had been getting difficult to keep off both the invasions at an equivalent time. So, the strategist king allied with Yashovarman of Kannuj to defend India from the invasions of both Tibetans and Arabs.
Legend has it that the Arab Caliphate had allied with Tibetans who were in perpetual conflict with the Chinese rulers represented at that point by the Tang . The alliance was also encroaching on the lands of Tang Empire albeit it had been considered a strong regime around 7th century A.D. Lalitadatiya having found a natural ally in China, made a sensible diplomatic move by aligning with the latter and took the advantage of the advanced Chinese military technologies that helped him in upgrading his own army.</p><p>
The famous Iranian scholar and historian Al Beruni records the victory of this newly formed alliance over the invading Arabs during a battle that was fought somewhere near Punjab. He even mentions that a festival was persisted the second day of Chaitra (March) per annum for hundreds of years to celebrate the victory. Later, Yashovarman defeated the Tibetan king and wrestled kingdoms of the North-East and Bangal which were under the dominance of Tibetan rulers. Lalitaditya didn't allow the Arabs to regroup and continued expanding his kingdom in Central Asia capturing parts of Afghanistan and Transoxiana which comprised the modern-day Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, southern Kyrgyzstan, and south-west Kazakhstan.</p><p>
Lalitaditya soon became wary of the increasing power of Yashovarman, who appeared to be getting afflicted with arrogance. This led to the breaking of the alliance. Consequently during a subsequent battle, Yashovarman also was defeated and he accepted the vassal status under Lalitaditya regime. due to this new status Yashovarman was obliged to later support Lalitaditya in defeating the latter’s arch rivals – the Later Guptas who controlled the Bengal region. it's believed that the queen of Deccan had approached Lalitaditya for help when her brother-in- law was trying to usurp the throne. Lalitaditya helped her in restoring her kingdom and sat her son Dantidurga on the throne. Dantidurga is claimed to possess gone on to determine one among the most important empires of South India referred to as Rashtrakutas.</p><h3>
BATTLES</h3><p>

The battles Lalitaditya fought are described by the renowned Kashmiri historian Kalhana in his classic history of Kashmir, the `Rajataringini’ (River of Kings) during which he says “The king, who carried his prowess, abandoned his (war-like) fury (only) when the (opposing) kings discretely folded their palms at his victorious onset. At the sound of his drums (beaten) in attack, the dwellings of his enemies were diverted by the (frightened) inhabitants and thus resembled women dropping in fright the burden of their wombs.”

On the event front Laliditya was an excellent builder. He reportedly cleared the silting of Vitasta (the present day Jhelum) river to stop flooding and directed the water through canals to far-flung regions. He even reclaimed swamps to spice up agriculture. he's also said to possess founded many present-day cities of Kashmir. Throughout his empires, he built the temples of the many gods including Buddha which shows his respect for other faiths. But sadly again, there's nothing that is still of those grand temples today due to the barbarity ushered in by the Muslim invaders. However the grandeur of those temples might be gauged even today by having an in-depth check out the ruins of the rare Martand Sun Temple and many other temples which were pulled down around 15th century AD.</p><p>
Ironically, as in life so in death, Lalityadita’s death remains a mystery. There are two versions concerning the death of this bravest son of India and Kashmir, both. One version is that he perished during a campaign in Aryanaka (Eastern Iran) thanks to heavy snowfall which occurred out of season. the opposite version, which is unlikely of a brave warrior of his stature, is that he committed suicide after being separated from his army on a difficult mountain</p>
