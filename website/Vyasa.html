Krishna Dvaipāyana, also known as Sage Vyasa is the author of the great Saga, Mahabharatha. He is also the author of great Vedas and Puranas. He is considered as the “Guru of Gurus”. It is believed that he is the incarnation of Lord Vishnu, who ascended from heaven above in the Dwaparayuga to propagate Dharma and righteousness. He also had a lot of students and among them, Umantu, Vaisampayana, Jaimini and Paila are noted ones. Many people believe that sage Vyasa is not just one person, but a lot of saints born time and then, whose main duty is to establish dharma.</p>

<h3 style="font-size: 2em;">Birth of Sage Vyasa:</h3>
<p>
Sage Vyasa was born to Sage Parashara and Satyavati Devi in an island on the banks of river Yamuna. He was born with a dark complexion and hence was named as Krishna. He was born on an island and was known as Dwaipayana. In his previous birth, he was born as Sage Apantaratamas, when Lord Vishnu, uttered the word “Bhu”. He is endowed with several mystical powers.</p>
<p>
Sage Parashara was an expert in astrology and has even composed a book Parashara Hora, which is even relevant and widely used today. He was the son of Sage Vashistha. Sage Parashara’s book Parashara Smriti is one of the renowned texts. His mother Satyavati was the daughter of Dusharaj, a fisherman. Sage Parashara performed severe austerities towards Lord Shiva and gained a lot of boons.</p>

<p>It was believed that Sage Vyasa was born immediately after Sage Parashara met Satyavati Devi, while he wanted to cross a river. Sage Parashara offered a mantra as a token of his gratitude. She immedietly recited the Mantra and got a child. He immediately attained adulthood and gained his knowledge from four Kumaras, Narada and Lord Brahma.
</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 2em;">Maharshi Vyasa as Veda Vyasa :</h3>
<p>
Vyasa is believed to be an expansion of the God Vishnu, who came in Dvapara Yuga to make all the Vedic knowledge from oral tradition available in written form. 
It is believed that the name "Veda Vyasa" (lit "compiler of the Vedas") is a title rather than an actual name. Dvaipayana was given the title as he mastered the one combined Vedic scripture and divided it into four parts — Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda. His spiritual career includes compiling many texts and spreading the knowledge through his disciples.
</p>
<p>
Vyasa had a son named name Shuka, who was his spiritual successor and heir.[b] As per Skanda Purana, Vyasa married Vatikā, alias Pinjalā, who was the daughter of a sage named Jābāli. It is described that Vyasa's union with her produced his heir, who repeated everything that he heard, thus receiving the name Shuka (lit. Parrot).</p>
<p>
Other texts including the Devi Bhagavata Purana also narrate the birth of Shuka but with drastic differences. Besides his heir, Vyasa had four other disciples — Paila, Jaimini, Vaishampayana and Sumantu.[8] Each one of them was given the responsibility to spread one of the four Vedas. Paila was the made the incharge of Rigveda, Jaimini of the Samaveda, Vaishampayana of the Yajurveda and Sumantu of Atharvaveda. </p>
Vyasa is believed to have lived on the banks of Ganga in modern-day Uttarakhand. The site was also the ritual home of the sage Vashishta, along with the Pandavas, the five brothers of the Mahabharata.
<h3 style="font-size: 2em;">Contributions of Sage Vyasa :</h3>

<h4 style="font-size: 1.5em;">The Mahabharata</h4>
<p>
Vyasa is traditionally known as the chronicler of this epic and also features as an important character in Mahābhārata, Vyasa asks Ganesha to assist him in writing the text. Ganesha imposes a precondition that he would do so only if Vyasa would narrate the story without a pause. Vyasa set a counter-condition that Ganesha understands the verses first before transcribing them. Thus Vyasa narrated the entire Mahābhārata and all the Upanishads and the 18 Puranas, while Lord Ganesha wrote.</p>
<p>
Vyasa's Jaya (literally, "victory"), the core of the Mahabharata, is a dialogue between Dhritarashtra (the Kuru king and the father of the Kauravas, who opposed the Pāndavas in the Kurukshetra War) and Sanjaya, his adviser and charioteer. Sanjaya narrates the particulars of the Kurukshetra War, fought in eighteen days, chronologically. Dhritarashtra at times asks questions and expresses doubts, sometimes lamenting, fearing the destruction the war would bring on his family, friends and kin.</p>
<p>
Large and elaborate lists are given, describing hundreds of kingdoms, tribes, provinces, cities, towns, villages, rivers, mountains, forests, etc. of the (ancient) Indian subcontinent (Bhārata Varsha). Additionally, he gives descriptions of the military formations adopted by each side on each day, the death of individual heroes and the details of the war-races. Eighteen chapters of Vyasa's Jaya constitute the Bhagavad Gita, a sacred text in Hinduism. The Jaya deals with diverse subjects, such as geography, history, warfare, religion and morality.</p>
<p>
The final version of Vyasa's work is the Mahābhārata. It is structured as a narration by Ugrasrava Sauti, a professional storyteller, to an assembly of rishis who, in the forest of Naimisha, had just attended the 12-year sacrifice known as Saunaka, also known as Kulapati.
Puranas 
Vyasa is also credited with the writing of the eighteen major Purāṇas, which are works of Indian literature that cover an encyclopedic range of topics covering various scriptures. His son Shuka narrates the Bhagavata Purana to Arjuna's grandson Parikshit.</p>

<h3 style="font-size: 2em;">Yoga Bhashya</h3>
The Yoga Bhashya, a commentary on the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, is attributed to Vyasa. 
<h4 style="font-size: 1.5em;">The Significance of Vyasa Purnima</h4>
<p>
In ancient times, our forefathers in India, went to the forest to meditate during the four months or ‘Chaturmasa’ following Vyasa Purnima—a particular and important day in the Hindu calendar. On this auspicious day, Vyasa began to write his Brahma Sutras. This day is also known as Guru Purnima when, according to the scriptures, Hindus should worship Vyasa and the Brahmavidya Gurus and begin the study of the Brahma Sutras and other ancient books on ‘wisdom’.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 2em;">
Brahma Sutras</h3>
<p>
<div style=" width: 40%;float: right;"><img src="vyasa.png" width="100%" height="50%" ></div>
The Brahma Sutras, also known as the Vedanta Sutras is believed to have been written by Vyasa along with Badarayana. They are divided into four chapters, each chapter being subdivided again into four sections. </p>
<p>
It is interesting to note that they begin and end with Sutras which read together mean "the inquiry into the real nature of Brahman has no return", pointing to "the way one reaches Immortality and no more returns to the world." About the authorship of these Sutras, tradition attributes it to Vyasa.
Sankaracharya refers to Vyasa as the author of the Gita and the Mahabharata, and to Badarayana as the author of the Brahma Sutras. His followers - Vachaspathi, Anandagiri, and others - identify the two as one and the same person, while Ramanuja and others attribute the authorship of all three to Vyasa himself. </p>
<h3 style="font-size: 2em;">Vyasa Contribution to astronomy and geography</h3>
<p>
Veda Vyasa not only focused on the work on Mahabharatha but also on astronomical and geographical knowledge. He interested in those subjects because his father Parasara also an astronomer, who had written astronomical texts like Parasara Samhita. Probably Vyasa got interested in astronomy and may guide by his father Parasara. He observed the positions of stars, planets and recorded the observations and the crucial incidents of Mahabharata. Those same observations helped the present day historians to date Kuru war. Vyasa also narrated the geography of ancient India, about several kingdoms, provinces, lakes, rivers, and mountains with their full names.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 2em;">
The Everlasting Influence of Vyasa</h3>
<p>
Vyasa is considered by Hindus as Chiranjivi or immortal, one who is still living and walking the earth for the well-being of his devotees. It is said that he appears to the true and the faithful and that Adi Sankaracharya had his darshan as did many others as well. Vyasa’s life is a unique example of one born for the dissemination of spiritual knowledge. His writings inspire us and the whole world even to this day in innumerable ways. To honor the great Saint, a temple has been built in Kalpi, Orai, Uttar Pradesh. This temple is known as Shri Bal Vyas Mandir. The contributions of Sage Vyasa is amazing and is unfathomable. He has set the path for humans to reach immortality, and the soul reaches the greatest divine state, where there is no return.</p>
