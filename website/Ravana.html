                        <span style="font-size:1.4em;">R</span>avana is the mythical multi-headed demon-king of Lanka in Hindu mythology. With ten heads and twenty arms, Ravana could become any form he wished. Representing the very essence of evil, he famously fought and ultimately lost a series of epic battles against the hero Rama, seventh avatar of Vishnu.</p>
<h3>
FAMILY</h3><p>
Ravana was a terrible demon (raksasa) who was the king of all demons and of the fortress island of Lanka (modern-day Sri Lanka). His father was Visravas (son of Pulastya, one among the creator Prajapati) and mother Nikasa, also a demon and mother of the cannibal demons, the Pisitasanas. Ravana acquired his throne through foul means when he expelled his half-brother Kubera, god of wealth, from the island. Rava had many sons, notably Aksa, who had three heads, symbolic of the three stages of fever (heat, cold, and sweating), and Indrajit (aka Meghanada), who could make himself invisible.
Ravana had a formidable appearance together with his ten heads (and so he's also referred to as Dasakantha and Panktigriva) and twenty arms. His body was covered in scars, won in endless battles with the gods. Three wounds, especially , were from the discus of Vishnu, the thunderbolt of Indra, and therefore the tusk of Airavata, the elephant of Indra. Through his devotion and penance to the good god Brahma, Ravana was made invincible and had the facility to assume any form he wished from men to mountains to death itself. He was so powerful that he could cause earthquakes and storms. However, it had been foretold that Ravana's end would come due to a lady , then it might be.</p><h3>
RAVANA AND NANDISA </h3><p>
The Ramayana is that the oldest Sanskrit epic and was written sometime within the 5th century BCE with some later additions. Ravana's name is explained, therein, during a colourful myth where the demon-king challenges Nandisa (actually the good god Shiva and also referred to as Nandisvara) and comes off worse. consistent with the story, at some point Ravana met a dark dwarf with a monkey face while he was passing through the mountains of Sara-vana. The dwarf wouldn't let Ravana pass because his master Shiva was busy hunting there and wasn't to be disturbed. Ravana questioned who this Shiva was and shook the mountain in rage. This disturbed Shiva and his wife Parvati, the latter trembled with fear as they sat upon the shaking peak but Shiva calmly placed his toe upon the bottom and therefore the whole mountain fell on top of Ravana's many arms. The demon let loose such a shuddering cry of pain that Shiva named the demon Ravana after his cry (rava). Ravana was only released from his predicament after 1,000 years of pleading to the good god.</p><p>  
The Ramayana is basically concerned with the story of the semi-divine Lord Rama, believed by many Hindus to be supported a historical figure. he's perhaps the foremost virtuous figure altogether of Hindu mythology. His adventures illustrate in particular the importance and rewards of fulfilling one's pious duty or dharma, and he had been born for one specific task - to answer the decision of the gods and kill the fearsome multi-headed demon Ravana, terror of the world .</p><p>
Rama's troubles began when he was exiled from his father's kingdom, a victim of a conspiracy concocted by his mother's jealous hunchback slave, Manthara. On top of that, his brother Bharata was made heir in Rama's place. For 14 years Rama had to wander the world , visit sages, and wait to fulfil his destiny.</p><h3>
RAVANA BATTLES RAMA</h3><p>
Rama, his wife Sita, and great friend Laksmana at some point eventually ended up at Pancavati along the river Godavari, a neighborhood suffering from demons. One especially , Surpanakha, the sister of Ravana, fell crazy with Rama, and when her advances were resisted, she attacked Sita in revenge. Laksmana was the primary to react and stop the ears and nose of Surpanakha. Not best pleased with this treatment, the enraged demoness gathered a military of demons to attack the trio. In an epic battle Rama defeated them all; however, Surpanakha wasn't finished with the matter, and she or he persuaded Ravana that Sita was a woman worth fighting for. Accordingly, the demon king sought out Rama's home, and while Rama was distracted within the search for a deer (who was actually Ravana's magician Maricha in disguise), abducted Sita, taking her back to Lanka in his aerial chariot to be kept captive within the beautiful Ashoka garden of his palace.</p><div style=" width: 35%;float: right;"><img src="ravan1.png" width="100%" height="40%" ></div><p>
Rama followed in hot pursuit. First he had to fight the monster Kabandha and assist the monkey king Sugriva, but as a gift for the latter, he gained the invaluable help of Sugriva's general Hanuman and his army. Hanuman was also the son of the wind and ready to leap huge distances, taking any form he wished. it had been he who magically transported Rama and his force to Lanka, crossing the rock bridge built by the skilled general Nala, which became referred to as Rama's Bridge.</p>
<p>
A series of titanic battles between Rama's forces and therefore the demons followed, sometimes Ravana got the whip hand , at other times Rama. In one fight, Rama managed to chop off one among Ravana's heads with an arrow but another immediately grew to exchange it. Finally, another of Rama's arrows was an immediate hit on Ravana's chest. The arrow went straight through the demon, travelled over the seas and came straight back to Rama's quiver. Ravana was dead and therefore the world obviate a terrible lawless force. Having been the son of a brahmana (priest), Ravana was given a correct funeral and his body burnt consistent with correct ritual. Lanka had, meanwhile, fallen to Rama's army, and therefore the hero headed back home to reclaim his throne and start a golden era of state.</p>
