S</span>hukracharya was the son of sage Bhrigu and nephew of bhakt prahlad. Sage Brigu’s first wife was Khyati who was daughter of Daxa; they had two sons Dhata and Vidhata along with a daughter Laxmi. Sage married his daughter to lord Vishnu. Bhrigu had more sons among them one was named Ushna which is believed to be another name of Shukracharya.</p><h3>
Becoming the Asur Guru</h3><p>
As Ushna reached his adolescence he was sent to sage Angiras to acquire his teachings. Sage Angiras was one of the best of Brahma’s sons. Also, he had a son named Brihaspati. Bhrihaspati used to study with Shukracharya. Between them, Shukracharya was sharp-witted and edgile. But as Brihaspti was the son of Angiras, the sage was biased about him which itched shukracharya a lot. Enraged by this preferential treatment, Sukracharya associated himself with demons and became their Guru(teacher/guide) for which he is also called Asuracharya. On the other hand, Brihaspati became Guru to Devtas(gods).</p><h3>
Getting the name Shukracharya</h3><p>
Once he duped Kuber and stole all his wealth. Gods complained about this to lord shiva. Enraged by this, Shiva gulped him. He resided in Shiva’s stomach for thousands of years till he realised his mistake and started doing penance to lord Shiva from within. Pleased by this, lord shiva exerted him in the form of Virya(Sperm) which is Shukranu. Because of this he is also called Rudra Putra(son of shiva) Shankaracharya.</p><h3>
Mrit Sanjivani Vidya</h3><p>
As we know there were several Devasur Sangram (Battles between gods and demons). Shukracharya was fed up with the constant defeat of Asuras so he decided to do Tapasya(penance) to please lord Shiva. To do so, he took off to the forest. On this side, He left all Asuras under the safety of his mother. To leverage his absence, Indra attacked Asuras. But, KhyatiMata(Some say Kavyamata) stunned Indra. Lord Vishnu then came to rescue Indra and while countering her Vishnu ended up chopping her head off. When sage Bhrigu came to know about demise of his wife, he cursed Lord Vishnu that he will have to go through the pain of birth again and again.</p><p>
Before this, Lord Vishnu’s avatars used to just appear out of nothing like Varah, Nrusinh and others. After this, he took birth as Lord Raama & Lord Krishna.
Coming back to Shukracharya, Lord Shiva gave him MritSanjeevani Vidya(Power of resurrection) which he then used for demons who had died in the war. This way he caused the victory of demons over gods.</p><h3>
Kacha & Sukracharya</h3><p>
Shukracharya’s rival and DevGuru Brihaspati sent his son Kacha as a student to Shukracharya to learn MritSanjivani Vidya. Even being well aware of Kacha, Shukracharya admitted him as his pupil. Against his acceptance, demons got upset to have him learning this power. They repeatedly tried to kill Kacha but almost every time Devyani (daughter of Shukracharya) would save him. <div style=" width: 38%; height : 380px;float: left;"><img src="sukra1.png" width="100%" height="100%" ></div>

Though, once asuras successfully killed kacha then they burned him and powdered his bones, mixed it with wine which they later served to Shukracharya. Unaware about this, Shukracharya tried to resurrect Kacha and called for him. But this time the voice of Kacha came from his own gut. Kacha came out, ripping Shukrcharya’s stomach open. But, he had learnt MritSanjivani Vidya by then; so he resurrected Shukracharya before leaving to join Devtas. Which ultimately balanced both sides and helped Devtas win the war.</p><h3>

<h3>Shukracharya’s eye</h3><p>
Once King Bali was doing a Yagya where Lord Vishnu came in Vaman Avatar and asked for a promise to give him whatever he desired. Shukracharya recognised him and asked the king to refuse this demand. But the king did not comply with his advice and took a water vessel to take a swear. Thus, Shukracharya went and kept his one eye at the outlet of the water vessel. Vaman then tried to clean it with a grassblade which blinded Shukracharya. Hence, he is also known as Ekaksha.

According to the story, when Lord Shankar swallows Shukrachaarya, then the poet (Shukracharya) in the stomach of Shankarji started praising Shankar Bhagwan, which pleased Shiva and allowed him to go out. When he wandered in the stomach of Mahadev for one divine year, but when he found no end, he again started praising Shiva. Then Lord Shankar laughed and said that you had become my son because of my stomach, so come out of my penis. From today you will be known by the name of Venus in all the pastures of the world. Bhargava appeared in Lord Shankar’s penis after obtaining Shukratva ever since the poet became famous as Shukra.</p><h3>
