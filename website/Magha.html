    					Among many of our ancient noted Sanskrit poets the name of Magha also stands out prominently. He was a seventh century poet and hailed from Gujarat. He was born in then Shrimala Nagar, present Bhinmal of Rajasthan. It seems he became the honoured Sanskrit poet at the court of King Varmalata at Shrimala which was then the capital of Gujarat.</p><h3>
Early life</h3><p>
Magha belonged to a Shrimali Brahmin family known to be quite rich. His father was Dattaka Sarvacharya and he was the grandson of Suprabhadika. Magha rose to fame as a poet chiefly for his heroic poem (Mahakavya) ‘Shishupal Vadh’. This heroic poem it seems was written in 20 ‘sargas’ i.e. Cantos and therefore the content was taken from an episode of Mahabharata. The content of the Epic was ‘Shishupala Vadh’ regarding the killing of Shishupal by Lord Krishna together with his Chakra (disc).</p><p>
Magha’s concluding five verses of his work are referred to as Prasasti during which it seems he has mentioned all about his parents, his birth place and being within the court of the King. Therefore these verses are called the Nija-Vamsa-Varnana or Kavi-Vamsa-Varnana by commentators.It is said, he was inspired by poet Bharavi and sometimes compared to him.
We learn that Magha was highly fashionable Sanskrit critics who didn't spare any chance to quote him intensely. As already mentioned, his Shishupala Vadha seems to possess been inspired by the Kiratarjuniya of Bharavi, and Magha even tried to emulate it and surpass him. Scholars commend that “Like Bharavi, he displays rhetorical and metrical skill quite the expansion of the plot, and is noted for his intricate wordplay, texture complexity and verbal ingenuity.” Scholars also opine that Magha has used an upscale vocabulary, such a lot in order that the claim has been made that Magha’s work contains almost every word within the Sanskrit language.</p><h3>
Works</h3><p>
Whilst comparing Magha’s works with Bharavi’s works, scholars find that Magha glorifies Lord Krishna whereas Bharavi glorifies Shiva. Moreover,while Bharavi uses 19 metres Magha uses 23; like Bharavi’s 15th canto filled with contrived verses, Magha introduces even more complicated verses in his 19th canto. a well-liked Sanskrit verse about Magha says (after translation):-</p><p>
“The similies of Kalidasa, Bharavi’s depth of meaning, Dandini’s wordplay—in Magha, all three qualities are found.” Another Sanskrit saying tells (after translation) “the lustre of the sun lasts until the arrival of Magha (coldest month), but the lustre of Bharavi lasts until the arrival of Magha.” Consequently, Magha is appeared to be more admired as a poet than his work as an entire and it's considered “even if the sections of the work which will be considered digressions from the story, have the character of an anthology and are more popular.”</p><p>
Magha has chosen his poem ‘Shishupala Vadh’ from an episode of the epic Mahabharata. to offer the gist of the story, to Shishupal Krishna wasn't only a cousin but a foe because Krishna had carried off Rukmini his intended wife. Furthermore, it had been foretold that Shishupala’s death was at the hands of Krishna. However, Krishna had given his vow to Shishupal’s mother (his aunt) that He would forgive Shishupala till he committed hundred wrongs but will kill him when he exceeded the limit. During the Rajasuya Yagnya held by Yudhishtira, Shishupala insults Lord Krishna calling Him a cowherd and not fit be honoured as a king at the Sacrifice (Yagnya). Shishupala throws more abuses at Krishna exceeding his limit with the result Krishna is compelled to behead Shishupala together with his Chakra (disc). Shishupala’s death is that the main subject of Magha’s famous Sanskrit heroic poem of Shishupala Vadh.</p><p>
We are told the story taken from the episode of the epic Mahabharata begins with an outline of an excellent light descending from the clouds and every one the people marvelling at it. The town people are amazed at this unique quite brilliance which they presume to be of the Sun or the hearth . Actually the sunshine was of the good sage Narada descending from heaven to warn Krishna about Shishupala! So skillfully has Magha presented the looks of sage Narada.</p><p>
In the words of students “Shishupala Vadh, an heroic poem in Sanskrit, is undoubtedly one among the foremost complex and delightful poetic works ever created. The masterpiece of poetry follows the story of Krishna as he marches to Indraprastha on his thanks to attend the good Sacrifice held by his friend Yudhishtira.” It seems Magha has too beautifully described intimately the chaotic march of Krishna to the Yagnya together with his army and also the supernatural great thing about the holy mountain Ralvataka and the environment where His army had camped
</p><p>According to one Sanskrit scholar, Paul M.M. Cooper “ However, it's not the sweetness of the poetry or the skill of the story teller that has impressed scholars throughout the ages, but the metrical skill in volume in its creation. Magha was a manipulator of the Sanskrit language who knew no equal.” Magha claims “The great height and wonder of the mountain need none of the false exaggerated embellishment of a poet” before extolling and describing its beauty and height in his main verses. He describes:-
The mountain sprouted trees, in whose branches magnificent peacocks lounged, round the trunks of which large snakes were twined, and from which the ideas of the many vines swung like pendulums.”</p><p>
Magha being a manipulator of the Sanskrit language is proved by some verse within the 19th Canto of his poem. To quote from Encyclopedia Britanica “ Shishupal Vadh comprising of 20 cantos features a rich vocubalary that allegedly includes every known word within the Sanskrit language. The 19th Canto which is noted for its complexity, contains a stanza that's just like the previous stanza if read backward.”
The Sanskrit scholar Paul M.M. Cooper writes that today, the Shishupala Vadha remains unobtainable in English. It seems there's fantastic version in German by Eujen Hultzsch and another in French by Hippolytic F. He deplores “Unfortunately, until some Sanskrit scholar of greater knowledge and patience than I comes along to translate it, the secrets and wonders of 1 of the world’s greatest poetic works will forever be obscure to us.”</p>
