SAGE BHARATA is the father of Indian theatrical arts and musicologist who authored the Natya Shastra. Indian drama, dance and music find their root in the Natyashastra. 
He was born in Kashmir between 200B.C and 400B.C. but some historians place him between 1000 and 500B.C. </p><p>
According to some critics he was a follower of Kashmir Shaivism.
He is also said to have collected all the material of earlier acharyas (ancient teachers) like Tumburu, Narada and Nandi and gave the Natyashastra a complete coherence by making additions, alterations and adaptations.</p><p> 
There was quite a large number of commentaries on the Nayashastra of Bharata. 
But all of them are unfortunately lost, except the Abhinava Bharata of Abhinavagupta. 
Besides Abhinavagupta, there are only three commentators. 
The earliest commentator of the Natyashastra is Lolata who gives the theory of the aropevada (attribution). </p><p>
Shankuka happens to be the second commentator of Bharata. 
The third commentator of Bharat is Acharya Bhattanayayaka who gave the theory of bhuktivada (theory of taste) based on sadharanikarana (generalization).
The next renowned exegete of Bharata is Abhinavagupta of roughly later half of the 10th and first half of the 11th C.E. </p><p>
 His concept of rasa has a profoundly philosophical basis. 
His concept of atmaprakasha (self-consciousness) is the expansion of Shaiva philosophy in which Paramashiva is equated with atma (soul) equipped with prakasha (light) 
The other comentators were bhattanayaka, Rahula, BhattaTauta , Kirtidhara, Vamadeva, Matrigupta etc.</p><h3>
Natyashastra</h3><p>

The Nayashastra known as Natyaveda or the fifth Veda, is a classical manual on the theory and practice of Indian aesthetic theatre, music, dance, poetics, gestures and many other allied arts given by Bharata Muni. 
The Nayashastra primarily aims at giving the necessary directions to actors.
It also aims at helping the aesthete, who is eager to enjoy the beautiful and afraid of the study of the Vedas and Puranas, which show the ways of realization of the main objectives of human life.</p><h3>
Date of Composition </h3><p>

It is also believed that Brahma took the element of song from the Samaveda, the tandava (vigorous dance) from Shiva, the lashya (grace)from Parvati and compiled the Nayashastra. 
As regards the view based on linguistic analysis The scholarly opinion varies placing it anywhere from 2nd century B.C.E. to 2nd century.</p><h3>
