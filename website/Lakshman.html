    					Brother from another mother. This saying most accurately fits the case of Ram and Lakshman. the 2 brothers were like two bodies and one soul. And hence, even today, devotees take their name within the same breath. Therefore, where there's Ram, there's Lakshman.</p><h3>
BIRTH AND GROWTH</h3><p>
Lakshman is believed to be the avatar of the Shesha Nag or Adishesha, the king of serpents, a fanatical devotee of Shri Hari Vishnu. The pictorial depiction of Shri Vishnu lying within the anantashayanam posture in Vaikuntha shows Adishesha shielding him together with his seven-headed hood. And since Adishesha is an integral a part of Shri Hari Vishnu's life, he took birth within the Tretayuga as Lakshman to serve Shri Rama as his younger brother.</p><p> Lakshman of Ramayan is one of the greatest heroes of all times, the one who epitomised dedication, devotion and unconditional love.</p><h3>
UNCONDITIONAL LOVE FOR RAMA</h3><p>
Lakshman selflessly served Rama without expecting anything reciprocally . Hence, without having second thoughts, he decided to accompany Rama for his van vaas (his stay within the forest), despite knowing that Kaikeyi only wanted Rama to travel to the forest, and not anyone else.
Lakshman was the son of the third wife of King Dasharath. His mother, Sumitra, had asked him to serve Shri Rama during the van vaas. She also asked him to stay awake all night to guard him from threats. And Lakshman followed every instruction of his mother and proved that he can never disobey her.Â </p><p>
Though Lakshman was Sumitra's son, he loved and revered Kaushalya (Ram's mother) equally. Hence, he asked Urmila, his wife, to seem after Kaushalya, while he stayed within the forest for fourteen years.
Those days, royals could have many wives. But like Ram, Lakshman remained dedicated to Urmila alone and didn't marry anyone else.</p><p>


After Lord Rama's coronation ceremony, Rama wanted to form Lakshman his successor. But Lakshman humbly declined the proposal and asked Rama to form Bharat, the Yuvraj. Pleased by his devotion and righteousness, Rama vowed to serve Lakshman within the Dwapar Yuga and express his gratitude. Ram was born as Krishna while Lakshman (Shesha Nag) took birth as Balaram.
