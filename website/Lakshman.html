    					Brother from another mother. This saying best suits the case of Ram and Lakshman. The two brothers were like two bodies and one soul. And hence, even today, devotees take their name in the same breath. Therefore, where there is Ram, there is Lakshman.</p><h3>
BIRTH AND GROWTH</h3><p>
Lakshman is believed to be the avatar of the Shesha Nag or Adishesha, the king of serpents, an ardent devotee of Shri Hari Vishnu. The pictorial depiction of Shri Vishnu lying in the anantashayanam posture in Vaikuntha shows Adishesha shielding him with his seven-headed hood. And since Adishesha is an integral part of Shri Hari Vishnu's life, he took birth in the Tretayuga as Lakshman to serve Shri Rama as his younger brother.</p><p>
In this web-post, we will tell you why Lakshman of Ramayan is one of the greatest heroes of all times, the one who epitomised dedication, devotion and unconditional love.</p><h3>
UNCONDITIONAL LOVE FOR RAMA</h3><p>
Lakshman selflessly served Rama without expecting anything in return. Hence, without having second thoughts, he decided to accompany Rama for his van vaas (his stay in the forest), despite knowing that Kaikeyi only wanted Rama to go to the forest, and not anyone else.
Lakshman was the son of the third wife of King Dasharath. His mother, Sumitra, had asked him to serve Shri Rama during the van vaas. She also asked him to remain awake all night to protect him from threats. And Lakshman followed every instruction of his mother and proved that he can never disobey her. </p><p>
Though Lakshman was Sumitra's son, he loved and respected Kaushalya (Ram's mother) equally. Hence, he asked Urmila, his wife, to look after Kaushalya, while he stayed in the forest for fourteen years.
Those days, royals could have many wives. But like Ram, Lakshman remained devoted to Urmila alone and did not marry anyone else. </p><p>


After Lord Rama's coronation ceremony, Rama wanted to make Lakshman his successor. But Lakshman humbly declined the proposal and asked Rama to make Bharat, the Yuvraj. Pleased by his devotion and righteousness, Rama vowed to serve Lakshman in the Dwapar Yuga and express his gratitude. Ram was born as Krishna while Lakshman (Shesha Nag) took birth as Balaram.
