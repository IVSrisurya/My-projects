                       <span style="font-size:1.4em;"> C</span>handragupta Maurya was the founder of the Maurya Empire in ancient India. He is credited with bringing together the small fragmented kingdoms of the country and combining them into a single large empire. During his reign, the Maurya Empire stretched from Bengal and Assam in the East, to Afghanistan and Balochistan in the West, to Kashmir and Nepal in the North and to the Deccan Plateau in the South. Chandragupta Maurya, along with his mentor Chanakya, was responsible in bringing an end to the Nanda Empire. After a successful reign of around 23 years, Chandragupta Maurya renounced all the worldly pleasures and turned himself into a Jain monk. It is said that he performed ‘Sallekhana’, a ritual of fasting until death, and therefore willfully ended his own life.

ORIGINS</h3><p>
There are many views when it comes to the lineage of Chandragupta Maurya. Most of the information about his ancestry comes from ancient texts of the Greek, Jains, Buddhist and ancient Hindu known as Brahmanism. There have been many research and studies conducted on the origins of Chandragupta Maurya. Some of the historians believe that he was an illegitimate child of a Nanda prince and his maid, Mura. Others believe that Chandragupta belonged to Moriyas, a Kshatriya (warrior) clan of a little ancient republic of Pippalivana, situated between Rummindei (Nepali Tarai) and Kasia (Gorakhpur district of Uttar Pradesh). Two other views suggest that he belonged either to the Muras (or Mors) or to the Kshatriyas of the Indo-Scythian lineage.</p><p> Last but not the least, it is also claimed that Chandragupta Mauryawas abandoned by his parents and that he came from a humble background. According to the legend, he was raised by a pastoral family and then was later sheltered by Chanakya, who taught him the rules of administration and everything else that is required for one to become a successful emperor.  </p><h3>
EMPIRE </h3><p>
As per various records, Chanakya was on the lookout for a suitable person to end the reign of a Nanda king and possibly the Empire as well. During this time, a young Chandragupta who was playing along with his friends in the Magadha kingdom was spotted by Chanakya. Impressed with Chandragupta’s leadership skills, Chanakya is said to have adopted Chandragupta before training him on various levels. Thereafter, Chanakya brought Chandragupta to Takshashila, where he turned all his pre-amassed wealth into a huge army in an attempt to dethrone the Nanda king.</p><p> 
Around 324 BC, Alexander the Great and his soldiers had decided to retreat to Greece. However, he had left behind a legacy of Greek rulers who were now ruling parts of ancient India. During this period, Chandragupta and Chanakya formed alliances with local rulers and started defeating the armies of the Greek rulers. This led to the expansion of their territory until finally the establishment of the Maurya Empire.</p><h3>
MAURYA EMPIRE:</h3><p>
Chanakya finally had the opportunity to bring an end to the Nanda Empire. In fact, he helped Chandragupta establish the Maurya Empire with the sole aim of destroying the Nanda Empire. So, Chandragupta, according to the advice of Chanakya, formed an alliance with King Parvatka, the ruler of the Himalayan region of ancient India. With the combined forces of Chandragupta and Parvatka, the Nanda Empire was brought to an end around 322 BC.</p>

Chandragupta Maurya defeated the Macedonian satrapies in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent. He then waged a war against Seleucus, a Greek ruler who had in control most of the Indian territories which were earlier captured by Alexander the Great. Seleucus however, offered his daughter’s hand in marriage to Chandragupta Maurya and entered into an alliance with him. With the help of Seleucus, Chandragupta started acquiring many regions and expanded his empire as far as South Asia. Thanks to this massive expansion, Chandragupta Maurya’s empire was said to be the most extensive in the whole of Asia, second only to the empire of Alexander in this region. It is to be noted that these regions were acquired from Seleucus who gave them up as a friendly gesture.</p><p>
After acquiring the provinces west of river Indus from Seleucus, Chandragupta's empire stretched across the northern parts of Southern Asia. Thereafter, began his conquests in south, beyond the Vindhya Range and into the Southern parts of India. Except parts of present day Tamil Nadu and Kerala, Chandragupta had managed to establish his empire throughout India.</p><h3>
FOUR PROVINCES</h3><p>
Based on the advice of Chanakya, his Chief Minister, Chandragupta Maurya divided his empire into four provinces. He had established a superior central administration where his capital Pataliputra was located. The administration was organized with the appointment of king's representatives, who managed their respective province. It was a sophisticated administration which operated like a well-oiled machine as described in Chanakya’s collection of texts called the Arthashastra.</p><p>
Chandragupta Maurya's son Bindusara succeeded him to the throne. Bindusara fathered a son, Ashoka, who went on to become one of the most powerful kings of the Indian subcontinent. In fact, it was under Ashoka that the Maurya Empire saw its complete glory. The empire went on to become one of the largest in the entire world. The empire flourished across generations for more than 130 years.</p> <p>Chandragupta Maurya was also responsible in uniting the most of present day India. Until the establishment of the Maurya Empire, this great country was ruled over by many Greek and Persian kings, forming their own territories. Till date, Chandragupta Maurya remains to be one of the most important and influential emperors of ancient India.</p>
