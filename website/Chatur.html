    				<div class="matter"><h3> Rig Veda</h3><p>
•Rig means “Praise”. It explains various hymns praising the elements of the nature <br> 
•The Rigveda was likely composed between roughly 1700-1100 BCE, making it one of the oldest texts of any Indo - Iranian language, this is one of the world’s oldest religious texts.<br>
•The RigVeda is considered to be among the earliest religious texts still reserved by a living tradition and it is estimated to have been formed around 1500 - 1200 BCE.<br>
•It consists of 10117 rhymes composed in Vedic Sanskrit. <br>
•It is a collection of brilliant songs or hymns and it is a main source of information in detail on the social, religious, , and economic background of the Rig-Vedic civilization. <br>
•It is the oldest book in any Indo-European language and contains the earliest form of all Sanskrit mantras. <br>
•Even though some of the hymns of Rig Veda characterize monotheism (belief in the existence of one god), naturalistic polytheism (belief in more than one god,) and monist (belief of different paths to the one god),these can be found in the hymns of Rig Veda. 
<br>

•The whole of the Rigveda-Samhita is in form of verses, known as Rik. ‘Rik’ is the name given to those Mantras which are meant for the praise of the deities. Thus the collection (Samhita) of Riks is known as Rigveda-Samhita.<br>
•The Rig-Vedic 'samhita' (collection of mantras) consists of 1,017 'suktas' (hymns) divided into eight 'ashtakas' (songs) each having eight 'adhyayas' (sections), which are sub-divided into various groups with a total of about 10,600 stanzas. These are classified into 10 books called Mandalas.
•Each Mandala is divided into several sections called Anuvakas. Each Anuvaka consists of a number of hymns called Suktas  This division of the Rigveda is most popular and systematic.<br>
• The hymns are collection of the work of many authors called 'rishis' (according to post Vedic tradition "seers"). Atri,Bharadvaja,Gautama Maharishi,Jamadagni,Kashyapa,Vasistha,Vishwamitra.<br>
•A Sukta is a group of Mantras. The number of Mantras in a Sukta is not fixed. Some Suktas have a small number of Mantras while others have a large number of Mantras. </p><p> 
As we know there are 1028 suktas , out of them these are some of the popular and frequently referred ones.
</p><p>
1.Purusha Sukta<br>
2.Hiranya-garbha Sukta<br>
3.Dhana-annadana Sukta<br>
4.Aksha Sukta<br>
5.Nasadiya Sukta<br>
6.Duhsvapna-nashna Sukta<br>
7.Yama-yami-samvada Sukta<br>
</p><p>
Besides these , there are many Suktas offered to different deities, such as, Indra, Maruta, Varuna, Usha, Surya, Bhumi, Soma, Agni etc.


The Aitareya, Kausitaki, and Samkhyana Brahmanas are the three  known extant Brahmanas of the RigVeda.
It is 'almost certainly the case that these two Brahmanas represent for us the development of a single tradition</p>
<h4> 
Aitareya Brahmana </h4><p> It is also known as Ashvalayana Brahmana.
This work is ascribed to Mahidasa Aitareya and dated variously from 1000 BCE to 500 BCE. It is divided into eight Panchikas
The first six panchikas of Aitareya Brahmana dealing with Soma Sacrifice (fire sacrifice ritual) and in the last two panchikas describe about Rajyabhisheka.
And in the Kaushitaki Brahmana It is divided into thirty chapters and 226 Khanda. The first six chapters dealing with food sacrifice and the remaining to Soma sacrifice. 
</p><p>

There are two aranyakas in rig veda </p><p>
Aitareya Aranyaka and Shankhayana Aranyaka<br>
•There are five chapters each of which is even considered as a full Aranyaka. <br>
•The first one deals with the regimen known as ‘Mahaa-vrata’. The explanations are both ritualistic as well as speculative. The second one has six chapters of which the first three are about ‘Praana-vidyaa.<br>
•The third Aranyaka elaborates on the various ways – like pada-paatha, krama-paatha, etc.<br>
•The fourth and the fifth Aranyaka are technical and well respectively on the yajna known as ‘Madhyandina’.
 Shankhayana Aranyaka </p><p>
They are the Vedic text containing spiritual thoughts related to Vedic Philosophy.
</p><p>

  The Upanishad of the Rig Veda is the Aitareya Upanishad.</p><p>
•The Aitareya Upanishad is a Mukhya Upanishad, associated with the Rigveda.<br>
• It consits of  fourth, fifth and sixth chapters of the second book of Aitareya Aranyaka, which is one of the four layers of Rig vedic text. <br>
•Aitareya Upanishad discusses three philosophical themes: first, that the world and man is the creation of the Atman (Soul, Universal Self); second, the theory that the Atman undergoes threefold birth; third, that Consciousness is the essence of Atman. <br>

<h3> 
 Yajur veda :
</h3><p>
The Yajur Veda that is “ The Book of Ritual “.</p><p>
•Yajurveda means “Worship of Knowledge”.<br>
•The Yajur-Veda or the wisdom of sacrifices is also a liturgical collection and was made to meet the demands of a ceremonial religion. <br>
•It lays down various "yajurs" (sacred incantations) which were chanted by a particular sect of priests called adhvaryu They performed the sacrificial rites.<br> 
•It has been, since the Vedic times, the primary source of information about sacrifices and associated rituals, more importantly, it has served as a practical guidebook for the priest, or the Purohits, as referred to as in Hindu dharma who execute the acts of ceremonial religion.<br> 
•Few hymns are also attributed to various Gods. However, the core of the Veda is dedicated to the theory of the rituals thereby making it very much ritual based.<br>


•The Yajurveda is broadly grouped into two – the "black" or "dark" (krishna) Yajurveda and the "white" or "bright" (Shukla) Yajurveda. <br>
•The term "black" implies "the un-arranged, unclear, collection" of verses in Yajurveda, in contrast to the "white" which implies the "well arranged, clear" Yajurveda.<br>
•The black Yajurveda has survived in four shakas, while two shakas of white Yajurveda have survived into the modern times.<br>
•Both of them have verses necessary for rituals, but the Krishna Yajurveda includes the Brahmana  discussions within the Samhita (no Brahman) while the Shukla Yajurveda has separately a Brahmana text, the Shatapatha Brahmana.<br>
•The Shukla Yajurveda has two branches: 
<br></p><p>
1.Vajasaneyi Madhyandiniya & <br>
2.Vajasaneyi Kanva.<br>
•Vajasaneyi Madhyandiniya is originally of Mithila and Vajasaneyi Kanva is of originally Kosala.<br>
•Krishna Yajurveda has 4 shakhas <br>
1.Taittiriya Samhita ( of panchala )<br>
2.Kathaka Samhita ( of Mafra and Kurukshetra )<br>
3.Kapishthala Samhita ( of Southern Punjab )<br>
4.Maitrayani Samhita ( of Kurukshetra )<br>
</p>

<h4> Brahmanas of Yajur Veda </h4><p>
That is the Shukla Yajurveda contains the Shatapatha Brahmana.<br>
•It is estimated to have been recorded around 1000-800 BCE.<br>
•It provides scientific knowledge of geometry and observational astronomy from the Vedic period, and is considered significant in the development of Vaishnavism as the possible origin of several Puranic legends and avatars of the Vedic god Vishnu, all of which (Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, and Vamana) are listed in the Dashavatara.
And the Krishna Yajurveda contains 4 brahmanas :<br>
1.Taittiriya Brhamana<br>
2.Maitrayani Brahmana<br>
3.Caraka-Kathaka Brahmana<br>
4.Kapisthala-Katha Brahmana<br>


•In the black Yajurveda, the Taittriya Aranyaka is a continuation of the Taitttriya Brahamana. In the white Yajurveda, the 14th book of the Satapatha Brahmana is in the name of Brihadarnayaka.<br>

Yajurveda, in contemporary Hinduism, has been a reminder of the ancient cultural heritage. The text is a useful source of information about agriculture, economic, and social life during the Vedic era. <br>
•Discussion about Upanishads, there are 2 upanishads in Shukla  Upanishad :<br>
1.Isha Upanishad<br>
2.Brihadaranyaka Upanishad<br>


Isha Upanishad is one of the shortest Upanishads.  A key scripture of the Vedanta sub-schools of Hinduism.
Brihadaranyaka Upanishad is among the largest and oldest as well. It is a key scripture of Hinduism that has influenced all schools of Hindu philosophy.<br>
•And in the Krishna Yajurveda
Taittiriya Upanishad
Katha Upanishad
Maitrayaniya Upanishad etc. are included.

•These texts offers a view of education system in ancient India. It also includes sections on ethics and invocation for one's personal development.<br>
•The Katha Upanishad found in the Yajurveda is among the most widely studied Upanishads.<br>


-Thus we can briefly say about the contents of Rigveda and Yajurveda that it has various subjects, which are narrated by Vedic seers poetically, philosophically or religiously.</p>

<h3> 
                        SAMA VEDA
</h3><p> 
It is the shortest of all the four vedas. This veda is seen as the origin for the field of sangita or music in Sanatana dharma.

The Sama Veda, divided into two major parts, first to include the four melody collections, or the Saman, the songs and the latter the Arcika, or the verse books a collection (Samhita) of hymns, portions of hymns, and detached verses. A liturgical text, relating to public worship, all but 75 verses of the total 1875 is derived from the Rig Veda.

research scholars point out its existing compilations to have been originated in the post-Rigvedic period, dating approximately around 1200 or 1000 BCE, also the period being contemporary to Atharvaveda as well as Yajur Veda.</p><p>  But at the same time, many scholars are quick to point out that no specific date of creation can be attributed to the Vedas, which reconciles with the claim of ardent believers of the Hindu dharma of the Veda being Apauruṣeya; meaning, not of a man or impersonal and also not belonging to a particular author.

Widely referred to as the ‘Book of Songs’, it is derived from two words, Saman, of Sanskrit, meaning Song and Veda, meaning Knowledge. It is the Sama Veda, that has served as the principal roots of the classical Indian music and dance tradition, and proudly the tradition boasts itself as the oldest in the world. The verses of Sama Veda, as the tradition had followed, is sung using specifically indicated melodies called Samagana by Udgatar priests at rituals dedicated to different deities.
</p><h3>
B. Form and Division:</h3><p> 
According to the ancient tradition, told by Patanjali, the Samaveda had 1000 rescensions (Shakhas). But at present there are only three rescensions. These are –
(1) Kauthuma (2) Jaiminiya (3) Ranayaniya But today, Kauthuma Shakha is known more prominently. The Samaveda- Samhita of Kauthumas, consists of two parts, Archika and gana. The Archika is also separated in two. – the Purvarcika, and the Uttararcika. First part contains four parts:</p><p>
1.Agneya – 114 verses for Agni<br>
2.Aindra – 352 verses for Indra<br>
3.Pavamana – 119 verses for Soma Pavamana<br>
4.Aranya – 55 verses for Indra, Agni, Soma etc. (And Mahanamni Mantras -10)</p><p> 
This part consists of 650 verses.</p><p> 
The Uttararcika, the second part of the Samaveda-Samhita, consists total number of 1225 verses. So the total number of verses in the Samaveda-Samhita is 1875. Amongst these 1771 Verses are from the Rigveda Only 99 verses of this Samhita are not found in the Rigveda- Samhita and thus are regarded to be of Samaveda itself.
The Gana part of the Samavead is also divided into Prakrti Gana and Uha Gana. Strictly speaking, the Uha Gana is not part of the original Veda but the application of the Samans from the Prakrti Gana based on the Purvarcika to the mantras of the Uttararcika.
</p><h3>
SAMHITHAS
</h3><p>
Samaveda is an independent collection (Samhita), yet it has taken many verses, a large number indeed, from the Samhita of Rigveda. These verses are chiefly derived from the eighth and the ninth Mandalas of the Rigveda. The Samaveda is compiled exclusively for ritual application, for its verses are all meant to be chanted at the ceremonies of the Soma-sacrifice and procedures derived from it. The Samaveda is, therefore, specially intended for the Udagatr priest. Its stanzas assume their proper character of musical samans or chants only in the various song-books called Ganas. According to the Jaiminiya Sutra – ‘Melody is called Saman.’</p><p>
Traditional the Vedas are spoken as‘Trayi‘, because thay are composed of three kinds in mantras- Rcs or verses, Yajus or prose, Saman or chants.
Among the four Vedas, the Samaveda is regarded as the foremost. In the Bhagavadgata, where Lord Krishna has declared “Among the Vedas I am Samaveda”-Vedanama Samavedosmi (Gita, 10.22). Here Indra, Agni and Soma deities are mainly invoked and praised but most of the time these prayers seem to be the invocations for the Supreme Being. In the spiritual sense Soma represents All-pervading, Glorious Lord and Brahman, who is attainable only through devotion and musical chanting. Thus major theme of the Samaveda can be regarded as worship and devotion (Upasana).</p><h4>

ARANYAKAS
</h4><h5>
TALAVAKARA ARANYAKA OR JAIMINIYOPANISHADBRAHMANA</h5><p>
Talavakāra Āraṇyaka belongs to Jaimini Śākhā of Sāmaveda. This is only available Āraṇyaka related to Sāmaveda. It is also known by the name ‘JaiminīyaUpaniṣadBrāhmaṇa’ or JaiminīyaTalvakāraUpaniṣadBrāhmaṇa.’ According to the Mangalācaraṇa of this Āraṇyaka, Jaimini was the teacher of TalavakāraṚṣi, this text,therefore, can be regarded as written by Talavakāra, a student of Jaimini. The Āraṇyaka is divided into four chapters (Adhyāya) which are again divided into subsections called Anuvāka and Khaṇḍa.</p><h4>
UPANISHADS</h4><p>

Two of the 108 Upanishads still extant are embedded in the Sama Veda, namely; Chandogya Upanishad and Kena Upanishad. Upanishads, in a way the essence of Vedas, are ancient Sanskrit texts that contain some of the central philosophical concepts and ideas of Hinduism and are also shared in some other religions like Buddhism and Jainism. The Chandogya Upanishad speculates about the origin of the universe and about space and time. Three proficient men in their Udgithas or chanting put forward some logical speculations even modern science could not outrightly reject. The Kena Upanishad tells us about how every man born has an innate longing for spiritual knowledge and that bliss comes only from spiritual attainment.
</p><h3>



ATHARVA VEDA
</h3><p>
The fourth and final of the revered text of the Hindu dharma, the Vedas, the Atharva Veda, in short, is depicted as “knowledge storehouse of Atharvāṇas” Atharvāṇas meaning, formulas, and spells intended to counteract diseases and calamities, or “the procedures for everyday life”. A late addition to the Vedic scriptures, the word owes its roots to Sanskrit and the widely used epithet for the scripture is ‘the Veda of Magic formulas’. As it sides with popular culture and tradition of the day rather than preaching religious and spiritual teachings, it is more often viewed not in connection with the three other Vedas, but as a discrete scripture.
</p><p>
It is a collection of 730 hymns with about 6,000 mantras, divided into 20 books, with three Upanishads embedded to it; Mundaka Upanishad, Mandukya Upanishad, and Prashna Upanishad. Though not all but a considerable part of it is the adaptation of Rig Veda, the most ancient of all Vedic Scripture. As the tales have it and alike other three Vedas, the believers of the Hindu dharma regard the Atharvaveda too as Apauruṣeya; meaning, not of a man or impersonal and also not belonging to a particular author. The hymns and the verses were written by the Rishis (or the Sages) and as the ardent believers of the Hindu dharma claim the revered Lord himself taught the Vedic hymns to the sages, who then handed them down through generations by word of mouth.
</p><h4>
SAMHITHAS
</h4><p>
●Shaunaka samhita<br>
●Paippalada samhita<br>
</p>
<p>
According to Patanjali, Atharvaveda had nine Shakhas, but the Samhita of the Atharvaveda is today available only in two rescensions – the Shaunaka and the Paippalada. It is the Shaunaka-Samhita that is frequently meant when the Atharvaveda is mentioned in ancient and modern literature. It is a collection of 730 hymns containing 5987 Mantras, divided into 20 books (Kandas). Some 1200 verses are derived from the Rigveda. About one sixth of the text of the Atharvaveda including two entire books (15 and 16) is written in prose, similar in style and language to the Brahmanas, the rest of the text is in poetic verses.
</p><p>
The Samhitas in the Atharva Veda have written accounts of Surgical and medical speculations, it includes mantras and verses for treating a variety of ailments. For instance, the verses in hymn 4.15 of the recently discovered Paippalada version of the Atharvaveda, it discusses how to deal with an open fracture, and how to wrap the wound with Rohini plant (Ficus Infectoria, native to India)
The Atharvaveda is looked upon as the Veda of varied knowledge. It contains numerous Mantras, which according to their subject-matter, can be broadly divided into three categories: 1. Related to the cure of diseases and destruction of adverse forces. 2. Related to establish peace, protection, health, wealth, friendship and long life. 3. Related to the nature of Supreme Reality, time, death and immortality.
Bloomfield has divided the subject of Atharvaveda into many categories, such as Bhashijya, Paushtika, Prayashctta, Rajakarma, Strikarma,Darshana, Kuntapa etc. Here some Important and famous Suktas of Atharvaveda are listed to have a general view its subject:</p><p>
1.Bhumi-Sukta (12.1)<br>
2.Brahmacarya-Sukta (11.5)<br>
3.Kala-Suktas (11.53, 54)<br>
4.Vivaha-Sukta (14th Kanda)<br>
5.Madhuvidya-Sukta (9.1)<br>
6.Samanasya-Sukta (3.30)<br>
7.Rohita-Sukta (13.1-9)<br>
8.Skambha-Sukla (10.7)</p><p>
So, the Atharvaveda is an encyclopedia of many subjects. It reflects the life of the Vedic people. Their thoughts related to philosophical, social, educational, political, agricultural, scientific and medical matters are found in this Samhita
</p><h4>
BRAHMANAS
</h4><p>
The Gopatha Brahmana is associated with the Atharvaveda and dividd into two khandas (chapters), i.e. Purvabhaga and Uttarabhaga. The Purvabhaga is divided into 5 prapathakas and 135 kandikas and the Uttarabhaga is divided into 6 prapathakas and 123 kandikas.
It is considered that this Brahmana is associated with both Shaunaka and Paippalada Shakha of the Atharvaveda.</p><h4>
ARANYAKAS
</h4><p>
No Aranynaka of Atharva Veda has come to light to date.
</p><h4>
UPANISHADS</h4><p>
The Atharvaveda has three primary Upanishads embedded within it.</p><h5>
  Mundaka Upanishad</h5><p>
It is a poetic-style Upanishad, with 64 verses, written in the form of mantras. However, these mantras are not used in rituals, rather they are used for teaching and meditation on spiritual knowledge.</p>
<h5>    Mandukya Upanishad</h5><p>
The Mandukya Upanishad is the shortest of all the Upanishads, found in the Atharvaveda text. The text discusses the syllable Om, presents the theory of four states of consciousness, asserts the existence and nature of Atman (Soul, Self).</p>

  <h5>   Prashna Upanishad</h5><p>
The Prashna Upanishad is from the Paippalada school of Atharvavedins.
The text contains six Prashna (questions), and each is a chapter with a discussion of answers.
