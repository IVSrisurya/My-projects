<span style="font-size:1.4em;">P</span>anini (500 BC) is the largest grammarian of the Sanskrit language. He was born in Gandhara, then northwest India. His grammar is named Ashtadhyayi which has eight chapters and about four Sahasra Sutras. Panini's contribution in giving grammatical form to the Sanskrit language is considered incomparable. Ashtadhyayi is not just a grammar text. In this way, a complete picture of the then Indian society is found. The geographical, social, economic, educational and political life of that time, the philosophical thinking, food habits, living conditions etc. are ranked in place.</p><h3>
Early life</h3><p>
 Panini was born in a village called Shalatur. This village was a few miles from the confluence where the river Kabul is found in the Indus. He is now called Lahur. According to his birthplace Panini is also called Shalaturya. And in the Ashtadhyayi he himself mentioned this name. The Chinese traveler Yuvanchwang (7th century) visited Shalatur village while coming from the north-west. Panini's guru's name was the father's name Panin and mother's name was Daakshi. When Panini grew up, he studied grammar deeply.
 </p><p> Before the watering, there were many teachers of vocabulary. By reading his texts and observing their mutual differences, Panini got the idea that he should organize grammar science. Earlier, before Panini, he had taken words for himself from the word which had expanded before the Vedic codes, branches, Brahmins, Aranyakas, Upanishads etc. which he has used in the Ashtadhyayi. They collected and studied the material of the second nirukta and grammar which was already there. The proof of this is also in the Ashtadhyayi, as is known by mentioning the opinions of Shakariyans, Shiklya, Bhardwaj, Gargya, Sanyak, Ashishli, Gulab and Blastatan etc. teachers.</p><p>
Ashtadhyayi has eight chapters and each chapter has four chapters. In the first chapters, there are nouns and definition related formulas, and there are regulatory episodes of verbs and nouns related to the nouns, such as self-meditation-verse-episode, and inflections for nouns, compounds etc. In the third, fourth and fifth chapters there is a law for all types of suffixes. In the third chapter, there is an interpretation of participant words by prefixing the metals and in the fourth and fifth chapters, detailed descriptions of new noun words formed by adding suffixes to nouns have been described.</p><p>
 The semantics that these suffixes reveal are called vritti in the definition of grammar, like Indradhanu occurring in the rain will be called the annual Indradhanu. The suffix "Ik", which expresses this special meaning occurring in the rain, is the suffixed suffix. There are 1,190 sutras in the episode and 631 in the Kridanta episode. In this way, only a little less than half of Ashtadhyayi's 1,821 formulas have been appropriated for the constitution of kriddanta, the corresponding suffixes.</p><h3>
Major Work</h3><p>
Panini had made a subtle investigation of the Sanskrit language of his time. On the basis of this investigation, the Grammar of which he spoke, he not only made the regulatory script of the Sanskrit language but also influenced the upcoming Sanskrit works. Even before the Panini, other teachers of grammar had attempted to bind this vast Sanskrit language into rule, but the science of water science proved to be great in all aspects of the expansion and cognition.</p><p>
 With the help of his deep insight, coordinated approach, concentration, skill, hard work and rich material, the great grammars preached with astonishment, many scholars were surprised and said - 'Paniniya Mahatsuvirichitam' - great scripture of Panini And is well known; 'Mahati Sukshmeksika Vartate Sutrakarasya' His vision is very sharp; 'Shobhana Khalu Panineh: Sutrasya Kritiyeh': His work is very beautiful; 'Paninishbado Loke Prakasate' Panini's name has been engraved in the whole world, etc. The commentator has addressed Panini to adjectives such as the certified Acharya, the Mangalika Acharya, the house, the Lord, etc.</p><p>
According to him, not a single word in Panini's sutra can be meaningless, and there is nothing in Paninian scripture that is meaningless. The formulas he has created have been made in a very thoughtful way. He has interpreted grammar as Suhrid. At the time of creation, his vision was towards the future and he used to think far and wide. In this way his reputation spread to children and his grammar became the most loved among the students.
  </p><p> Maharishi Panini was the greatest grammatologist of Sanskrit language. He was born in Gandhara, North West India. Many historians consider him the elder brother of Maharishi Pingal. His grammar is named Ashtadhyayi which has eight chapters and about four Sahasra Sutras. Panini's contribution in giving grammatical form to the Sanskrit language is considered incomparable. Ashtadhyayi is not just a grammar text. In this way, a complete picture of the then Indian society is found. The important work done by them in the context of language started coming to light in the 19th century.</p><h3>
Impact On Europe & Rest Of The World</h3><p>
Franz Bopp (14 September 1791 - 23 October 1867), a linguist of Europe in the 19th century saw the work of Mr. Panini. He found new ways to further mature the modern language system in the texts written by Panini and in Sanskrit grammar. After this, many Sanskrit foreigners showed interest in his works and did intensive studies such as: Ferdinand de Saussure (1857–1913), Leonard Bloomfield (1887 - 1949) and a recent linguist Frits Staal (1930 - 2012).</p><p>
 In grammar, Panini tried to establish co-ordination between the Nairukta and Garga sects. According to the Naruukta sect and Shaktayan, the nouns are made of metals. The opinion of Gargya and other personalizations differed somewhat from this. He said, it is not appropriate to provoke each word with metals. Panini considered the words 'Unadi' to be inappropriate, and by affixing the metal, placed the proven words in the word 'Krdant'.
According to Panini, both 'Anuprahamana' and 'Yogapramana' are favored and necessary in their respective places. From the word, there is a sense of caste, or of the person, in this regard also, Panini has recognized both the opinions in a timely manner. The meaning of metal is 'yes' or 'bhav', it also comes a question. Panini has accepted both.
 </p><p> Panini has composed his 'Ashtadhyayi' by taking the basis of these texts Ganapath, Dhatrapath, Unadi, Linganushan and Fitasutra. Along with the Ashtadhyayi, there is a need for reading and reading of education texts for pronunciation. All these subjects are included in the Panini Praneet Grammatics. According to Patanjali, Ganapath was composed before Panini grammar.
 </p><p> The collection of words falling under a rule of grammar, despite being mutually distinct, is included in 'Ganapath'. The sequence of words stored in the text is often fixed. For small rules in Gana, the implementation of Sutras has to be shown. Ganapathi will be composed by the Panini Puraskar Acharyo. Nevertheless, she has become an important part of Panini grammar.</p>

 There is no such sentence in English, after careful analysis of each word from 800 metals and each idea of the material provided by Panini, the 121 fundamental concepts cannot be extracted. "In April 1993, the first softwear man to Maharishi Panini in the MLBD Newsletter (a monthly of Indological Bibliography), without declaring hardwear.
 </p><p> Which states "The main title was" Sanskrit software for future hardware "After three decades of trying to make natural languages (natural language is only Sanskrit, everything else is human), suited to computer programming, scientists He realized that even in computer programming, we were defeated 2600 years ago.
 Although how and where we used this fact at that time cannot be said, even today, computer scientists across the world believe that in modern times Sanskrit grammar is capable of solving all computer problems. In this magnificent text of grammar, Panini has stored 4000 formulas of inflectional Sanskrit language very scientifically and logically.
</p><p>NASA scientist Mr.Rick Briggs discovered the chain between artificial intelligence and Panini grammar in America. Making natural languages friendly to computer programming was very fun work until Mr. Rick Briggs. The use of Sanskrit was not explored. After that millions of dollars were spent on a project with many countries.
 Their timing is uncertain and disputed. It is certain that they must have existed after the sixth century BC and before the fourth century BC. It is believed that he was born in Shalatala in Punjab, which is close to modern Peshawar (Pakistan). It is believed that Panini must have used some medium to write because the words he used were extremely clean and his analysis without writing seems unlikely.</p><p>
Many say that he used the memory of his disciples as his writing book. The reuse of the script in India (after the Indus Valley Civilization) took place in the 6th century BC and the first use of the Brahmi script took place in Tamil Nadu in South India, away from Gandhara in northwest India. Gandhara had Persian rule in the 8th century BC and it is possible that they may have used the Armaic characters.</p>
