    					<span style="font-size:1.4em;">C</span>hatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was the founding father of the Maratha Empire in western India. he's considered to be one among the best warriors of his time and even today, stories of his exploits are narrated as a neighborhood of the folklore. together with his valor and great administrative skills, Shivaji carved out an enclave from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur. It eventually became the genesis of the Maratha Empire. After establishing his rule, Shivaji implemented a competent and progressive administration with the assistance of a disciplined military and well-established administrative set-up. Shivaji is well-known for his innovative military tactics that centered around non-conventional methods leveraging strategic factors like geography, speed, and surprise to defeat his more powerful enemies.</p><h3>
BIRTH AND GROWTH</h3><p>
Shivaji Bhosle was born on February 19, 1630 to Shahaji Bhosle and Jijabai within the fort of Shivneri, near the town of Junnar of the Pune district. Shivaji’s father Shahaji was in commission of the Bijapuri Sultanate - a tripartite association between Bijapur, Ahmednagar, and Golconda, as a general. He also owned a Jaigirdari near Pune. Shivaji’s mother Jijabai was the daughter of Sindkhed leader Lakhujirao Jadhav and a deeply religious woman. Shivaji was especially on the brink of his mother who instilled in him a strict sense of right and wrong. Since Shahaji spent most of his time outside of Pune, the responsibility of overseeing Shivaji’s education rested on the shoulders of alittle council of ministers including a Peshwa (Shamrao Nilkanth),a Mazumdar (Balkrishna Pant), a Sabnis (Raghunath Ballal), a Dabir (Sonopant) and a chief teacher (Dadoji Konddeo). Kanhoji Jedhe and Baji Pasalkar were appointed to coach Shivaji in military and martial arts. Shivaji was married to Saibai Nimbalkar in 1640.</p><p>
Shivaji clothed to be a born leader from a really young age. a lively outdoorsman, he explored the Sahayadri Mountains surrounding the Shivneri forts and came to understand the world just like the back of his hands. By the time he was 15, he had accumulated a band of faithful soldiers from the Maval region who later aided in his early conquests.</p><h3>
BATTLES AND CONQUESTS</h3><p>
By 1645, Shivaji acquired control of several strategic from under the Bijapur Sultanate around Pune – Torna from Inayat Khan, Chakan from FirangojiNarsala, Kondana from Adil Shahi Governor, along side Singhagarh and Purandar. Following his success, he had emerged as a threat for Mohammed Adil Shah who gave the order to imprison Shahaji in 1648. Shahaji was released on condition that Shivaji kept a coffee profile and kept from further conquests. Shivaji resumed his conquests after Shahaji’s death in 1665 by acquiring the valley of Javali from Chandrarao More, a Bijapuri jaigirdaar. Mohammed Adil Shah sent Afzal Khan, a strong general in his employ to subdue Shivaji.</p><p>
The two met in a private rendezvous on November 10, 1659 to discuss terms of negotiation. Shivaji anticipated it to be a trap and he arrived prepared wearing armor and concealing a metal tiger claw.  When Afzal Khan attacked Shivaji with a dagger, he was saved by his armour and Shivaji retaliated by attacking Afzal Khan with the tiger’s claw, mortally injuring him. He ordered his forces to launch an assault on the leaderless Bijapuri contingents.</p><p> Victory was easy for Shivaji within the Battle of Pratapgarh, where around 3000 Bijapuri soldiers were killed by the Maratha forces. Mohammed Adil Shah next sent a bigger army under the command of General Rustam Zaman who faced Shivaji within the Battle of Kolhapur. Shivaji secured victory during a strategic battle causing the overall to escape for his life. Mohammed Adil Shah finally saw victory when his general Siddi Jauhar successfully sieged the fort of Panhala on September 22, 1660. Shivaji recaptured the Fort of Panhal later in 1673.

<h3>
LANGUAGE:</h3><p>
Shivaji vigorously promoted the utilization of Marathi and Sanskrit in his court rather than Persian, the prevailing Royal language. He even changed the names of the forts under his control to Sanskrit names to accent his Hindu rule. Although Shivaji himself was a devout Hindu, he promoted tolerance for all religion under his rule. His administrative policies were subject-friendly and humane, and he encouraged liberty of girls in his rule.He was strictly against caste discrimination and employed people from all caste in his court. He introduced the Ryotwari system eliminating the necessity for middlemen between farmers and therefore the state and collecting revenues directly from the manufacturers and producers. Shivaji introduced the gathering of two taxes called the Chauth and Sardeshmukhi. He divided his kingdom into four provinces, each headed by a Mamlatdar. Village was the littlest unit of administration and therefore the head was titled as Deshpande, who headed the Village Panchayat. Shivaji maintained a robust military unit , built several strategic forts to secure his borders and developed a robust naval presence along the Konkan and Goan coasts.
