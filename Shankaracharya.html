A</span>di Shankara was an Indian philosopher and theologian who expounded the doctrine of Advaita Vedanta. He renounced the worldly pleasures at a really young age. Shankaracharya amalgamated the ideologies of ancient ‘Advaita Vedanta’ and also explained the essential ideas of Upanishads. He advocated the oldest concept of Hinduism which explains the unification of the soul (atman) with the Supreme Soul (Nirguna Brahman). </p><p>
Though he's best known for popularizing ‘Advaita Vedanta’, one among Shankaracharya’s most vital works is his efforts to synthesize the six sub-sects, referred to as ‘Shanmata.’ ‘Shanmata’, which accurately translates to ‘six religions,’ is that the worship of six supreme deities. Shankaracharya explained the existence of 1 God (Brahman) which the six supreme deities are a part of one divine power. He also founded ‘Dashanami Sampradaya,’ which talks about leading a monastic life.</p><p>
While Shankaracharya was a firm believer in ancient Hinduism, he condemned the ‘Mimamsa school of Hinduism’ which was purely supported ritual practices. Throughout the course of his journey, Shankaracharya discussed his ideas with various other philosophers and fine-tuned his own teachings from time to time. Shankaracharya founded four monasteries (mathas) that still spread his teachings.</p><h3>
Birth</h3><p>
Shankara, as he was known before becoming an excellent teacher, was born into a poor Brahmin family at Kaladi, present day Kerala, India. His parents, Sivaguru and Aryamba, offered their prayers to Lord Shiva, requesting the deity to bless them with a toddler . 
Their prayers were soon answered within the sort of a baby boy. a couple of theories suggest that Aryamba had a dream during which Lord Shiva himself promised her that he would be taking birth as her child. Hence, many consider Shankara as a reincarnation of Shiva. Shankara was educated by his mother as he lost his father when he was just seven. Aryamba played a key role in teaching Vedas and Upanishads to a young Shankara.</p><p>
There is a lot of confusion regarding the birth-date of Shankara as different sources have proposed several different dates. The most accepted birth-date places him as a scholar from the first half of the 8th century CE.</p><h3>
Life</h3><p>
Throughout the course of his youth , Shankara astounded many together with his knowledge intelligence. He started writing his own analysis of the Upanishads, Brahma Sutras and therefore the Bhagavad Gita at a young age. Right from his childhood, he was keen on becoming a monk. Though his idea of becoming a monk was opposed by his mother, Shankara knew exactly what he had to try to to . Once he accompanied his mother to a close-by river and took a plunge into the river.</p><p> 
Suddenly, a crocodile appeared from beneath the river and caught hold of his leg. Shankara then cried bent his mother, saying that a crocodile was pulling him into the river. When his mother felt helpless, Shankara urged her to permit him to die as a monk. As soon as Aryamba gave her consent, the crocodile spared Shankara’s life and went back to the river.
</p><p>
Shankara was miraculously unharmed and went on to become a monk as his mother had already given him the permission to try to to so. He then went in search of a guru and consistent with a couple of ancient scripts, a young Shankara walked a minimum of 2000 kilometers before meeting Govinda Bhagavatpada. Under Govinda Bhagavatpada’s guidance, Shankara studied ‘Gaudapadiya Karika’, ‘Brahmasutra’, Vedas, and Upanishads. To his teacher’s amazement, Shankara was ready to master most the traditional scripts during a short time. He even started writing commentaries on major religious scripts. Once he had a transparent understanding of the traditional Hindu scripts, he started traveling across India, propagating ‘Advaita Vedanta’ and ‘Dashanami Sampradaya.’</p><p> 
During the course of his journey, Shankara’s teachings were challenged by many philosophers and thinkers. He was even involved during a number of debates concerning Hinduism and its beliefs, but Shankara managed to astound all his doubters together with his intelligence and clarity. He then went about propagating his ideas and was soon accepted as a guru by many.</p><h3>
Disciples</h3><p>
Shankara came to be known as Shankaracharya among his disciples. Though he had several disciples, four of them would go on to achieve great heights to be later considered as Shankaracharya’s main disciples. They were also entrusted with the responsibility of heading the four monasteries (mathas) founded by Shankaracharya. Here are Shankara’s four disciples:</p><p>
<h4>Padmapada</h4> Padmapada was born Sanandana and later went on to become one among the foremost ardent followers of Adi Shankaracharya. consistent with the traditional texts, Sanandana was once drying his master’s clothes on the banks of Ganges. When Shankaracharya asked for his clothes from the opposite side of the river, Sanandana started crossing the mighty Ganges, holding his master’s clothes on the brink of his chest. To the amazement of the onlookers, many lotuses emerged from the river and supported Sanandana’s weight, saving him from drowning. After crossing the river, Sanandana handed the garments over to Shankaracharya who then bestowed him with the name ‘Padmapada’ which accurately means ‘the one with lotus feet.’ Padmapada founded ‘Thekke Matham’, a monastery in Thrissur, Kerala.</p><p>
<h4>Totakacharya</h4> </p><p>
<h4>Hasta Malaka</h4> When Shankaracharya visited a village near Kollur (Karnataka), a Brahmin named Prabhakara came forward, in conjunction with his son, to satisfy him. Prabhakara told him that his son could also be a lunatic which he's good for nothing. Shankaracharya verified his son and asked him a few of questions. The boy then replied in verses which explained Advaita philosophy. Amazed by his knowledge, Shankaracharya named him Hasta Malaka and accepted him as his disciple. Hasta Malaka founded ‘Idayil Matham’ in Thrissur.</p><p>
<h4>Sureshvara</h4> Sureshvara was born Mandana Misra and was leading the lifetime of a mean householder. Misra was a superb exponent of ‘Karma Mimamsa’ and was considered Shankaracharya’s contemporary. When Shankaracharya finally met the famous Mandana Misra, he challenged him to a debate. After a furious debate which went on for months, Mandana Misra finally accepted defeat and agreed to become Shankaracharya’s disciple. He came to be mentioned as Sureshvara and founded 'Naduvil Matham' in Thrissur.</p><h3>
Death</h3><p>
At the age of 32, Adi Shankaracharya retired to the Himalayas and is believed to possess entered a cave near Kedarnath. He was never seen again and therefore the cave that he entered is taken into account as his final resting place.</p><h3>
Works</h3><p>
Adi Shankaracharya is renowned for his spectacular commentaries on ancient texts. His review of ‘Brahma Sutra’ is understood as ‘Brahmasutrabhasya’, and it's the oldest surviving commentary on ‘Brahma Sutra’. it's also considered as his best work. He also wrote commentaries on Bhagavad Gita, and therefore the ten principal Upanishads. Adi Shankaracharya is additionally well-known for his ‘stotras’ (poems). He composed many poems, praising gods and goddesses. those dedicated to Krishna and Shiva are considered most vital among his ‘stotras’. He also composed the famous ‘Upadesasahasri’ which accurately translates to ‘a thousand teachings.’ ‘Upadesasahasri’ is one among his most vital philosophical works.</p><h3> 
Philosophy</h3><p>
Adi Shankaracharya’s philosophy was simple and easy . He advocated the existence of the soul and therefore the Supreme Soul. He believed that the Supreme Soul alone is real and unchanging while the soul may be a changing entity which it doesn't have absolute existence. </p>
<h3>Influence on Hinduism</h3><p>
Adi Shankaracharya became a key figure in restoring belief within the Vedas and Upanishads. Smartism, a subsect of Hinduism, was formed supported his teachings. he's also credited with making Hindus understand the existence of 1 God . He explained that each one other deities are just different sorts of the God . The monasteries founded by Shankaracharya had an excellent influence in reforming Hinduism. </p><h3>
Mathas</h3>
Adi Shankaracharya founded four monasteries (mathas) - one each at the four cardinal points in India. Here are the four mathas founded by Shankara:
<h4>Sringeri Sharada Peetham </h4>–<p> This was the first monastery founded by Adi Shankaracharya. It is located at the southern part of India, along the banks of Tunga. Sureshvara was made the head of this matha as Shankaracharya moved on to establish other mathas. Sringeri Sharada Peetham advocates ‘Aham Brahmasmi’ (I am Brahman) and was formed on the basis of Yajur Veda.</p>   
<h4>Dvaraka Pitha -</h4> <p>Dvaraka Pitha is located in the western part of India. Hasta Malaka, who came to be known as Hastamalakacharya, was made the head of this matha. Dvaraka Pitha advocates ‘Tattvamasi’ (That thou art) and was formed on the basis of Sama Veda.</p>
<h4>Jyotirmatha Peetham–</h4> <p>This monastery is found within the northern a part of India. Totakacharya was made the top of this matha which advocates ‘Ayamatma Brahma’ (This Atman is Brahman). Jyotirmatha Peetham was formed on the idea of Atharva Veda.
Govardhana matha - Govardhana matha is found at the eastern a part of India. The matha may be a a part of the famous Jagannath temple. Padmapada was made the top of this monastery which advocates ‘Prajnanam Brahma’ (Consciousness is Brahman). it had been formed on the idea of Rig Veda. </p><h3>
Final rites of his mother</h3><p>
Shankaracharya was somewhere in North India when he came to understand of his mother’s impending death. By using his Yogic powers, travelled through the air to succeed in her quickly. At her request, he granted her divine visions.
When he tried to rearrange the cremation of his mother’s body, his relatives refused to assist him on the grounds that as a Sannyasi he wasn't permitted to perform funeral rites. Normally this is able to are a significant setback as a cremation involves rituals, which might require physical assistance by a couple of people. So Shankaracharya performed a miracle. He made a pyre out of plantain stalks. 

After placing the body on the pyre he took some water and after chanting a couple of mantras he sprinkled the water on the pyre. Immediately the pyre caught fire. Thus he was ready to complete the funeral rites without help.
