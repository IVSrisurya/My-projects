Varahamihira's main work is that the book Pañcasiddhāntikā ("[Treatise] on the Five [Astronomical] Canons") dated ca. 575 CE, which provides us information about older Indian texts which are now lost. The work could also be a treatise on mathematical astronomy and it summarises five earlier astronomical treatises by five authors, namely the Surya Siddhanta, Romaka Siddhanta, Paulisa Siddhanta, Vasishtha Siddhanta and Paitamaha Siddhanta. it is a compendium of Vedanga Jyotisha also as Hellenistic astronomy (withGreek, Egyptian and Roman elements).

They [the Indians] have 5 Siddhāntas:</p><p>

One such invaluable contribution is that the introduction of zero in mathematics and therefore the decimal method of calculation. Varahamihira compared Surya Siddhanta together with his four other panchsiddhantika treatises, namely Paitamaha Siddhantas, Paulisha Siddhantas, Romaka Siddhantas, and Vasishta Siddhantas. The Surya Siddhanta is additionally mentioned in Aryabhata's writings.</p><h3>
