    					<span style="font-size:1.4em;">S</span>hudraka was an Indian author, to whom 3 Indo-Aryan plays area unit attributed: Mrichchhakatika (The very little Clay Cart), Vinavasavadatta, and a bhana (short one-act monologue), Padmaprabhritaka. in keeping with the introduction of Mrichchhakatika, he was a king; in keeping with one theory, he might are a 3rd-century Abhira king. in keeping with another theory, Shudraka may be a legendary figure, and also the authorship of plays attributed to him is unsure. </p><p>In the introduction of the play Mrichchhakatika, the supervisor states that its writer was a wise king noted as "Shudraka". He had performed Ashvamedha (horse sacrifice) ritual to prove his superiority, and immolated himself at the age of one hundred ten years, once crowning his son because of the new king. The introduction describes him as a distinguished intellectual, World Health Organization had gained information of the Rigveda, the Samaveda, arithmetic, the Kamashastra, and also the art of coaching elephants.</p><h3>
Shudraka-katha  </h3><p>
Two lost works titled Shudraka-Katha (IAST: Śūdraka-kathā, "the story of Shudraka") area unit familiar from alternative sources. A verse attributed to the tenth-century writer Rajashekhara in Suktimuktavali praises 2 writers - Ramila and Somila - for put together composing a completely unique titled Shudraka-Katha. as a result of it's delineated as a completely unique, it absolutely was most likely a piece of fiction. Another Shudraka-Katha, attributed to an author referred to as Pancha-shikha, is thought from alternative sources.</p><p> 
Based on data from alternative sources, it seems that one Shudraka-katha (probably that of Ramila and Somila) narrated however Shudraka won over a lady referred to as Vinaya-vati, with the assistance of his friend Bandhu-datta. the opposite work (probably that of Pancha-shika) was a Prakrit-language novel that featured a heroine named Harimati And a previous parrot acting as her traveler.</p><p>
Dandin's Avanti-Sundari provides an outline of the varied narratives regarding Shudraka, which most likely supported these novels. Avanti-Sundari-Katha-Sara, a paraphrased version of Dandin's work, states that Shudraka was originally referred to as Indrani-Gupta. though born a Brahmin himself, he unloved the Brahmins and was cursed as a result. once many misfortunes, he became a mortal and bought a royal fortune. </p><p>
According to Rajashekhara's Kavya-Mimamsa, Shudraka was supposed as a patron of literature and presided over a literary circle.[9] Some legends present Shudraka as a ruler of the central Asian nation. E.g. the Kadambari places him in Dasharna, and also the Avanti-Sundari-Katha-Sara calls him "Malava-raja" (the king of Malava). Bhoja's Shringara-Prakasha additionally mentions the narratives regarding Shudraka. Vidyapati's Purusha-pariksha contains a whimsical story that portrays Shudraka as a perfect lover.</p><h3>
Identification</h3><p>
No historical records mention a king by the name Shudraka (which virtually means that "little servant"). the primary four acts of Mrichchhakatika area unit just about a replica of the corresponding acts from Bhasa's unfinished play Charudattam. One theory is that the writer of Mrichchhakatika merely finished Bhasa's play out of respect, styling himself because of the "little servant" of Bhasa.</p><h3>
Mrichchhakatika</h3><p>
A fourteenth-century text attributes Mrichchhakatika to a pair, Bhartrimentha, and Vikramaditya. The Mrichchhakatika is ready in Ujjain. it's familiar that AN Ujjain-based writer by the name Bhartrimentha was recent of Kalidasa; the legendary king Vikramaditya additionally lived in Ujjain. However, distinctive these 2 because the authors of Mrichchhakatika is chronologically not possible.</p><p>
Indologist A. K. warden notes that even the earliest sources that mention Shudraka gift him as a legendary figure. Therefore, the existence of Shudraka is uncertain. Some students, like Farley P. Richmond, recommend that Shudraka was merely a legendary figure, and also the authorship of works attributed to him is not sure.</p><p>
According to another theory, 1st planned by Sten Konow, Shudraka was the pseudonym of a third-century Abhira king, presumably Shivadatta, the daddy of Ishvarasena). This theory is supported by the subsequent points:</p><p>
•The Abhiras succeeded or supplanted the Satavahanas, World Health Organization are called the Andhras, and World Health Organization were most likely overlords of the Abhiras at only once. A Skandapurana legend calls Shudraka AN AN, which means a liegeman of the Andhras. in keeping with the Jain tradition (e.g. Vividha-Tirtha-Kalpa), a king named Satavahana gave Shudraka 1/2 his empire. in keeping with alternative legends, like the one mentioned in Dandin's Avanti-Sundari, Shudraka either ascended the throne once the premature death of the Satavahana aristocrat Svati or defeated Svati.</p><p>
•Avanti-Sundari-Katha-Sara mentions that Shudraka was born within the Ashmaka region. The Vividha-Tirtha-Kalpa states that he was born in Pratishthana, which is found within the same space. Shudraka is among the earliest dramatists to use the Maharashtri Prakrit, the language of this space, in a play.</p><p> 
•The Skandapurana places Shudraka within the Kali year 3290, which corresponds to 188 cerium, on the point of the Abhira amount. </p><p>
•Shudraka invokes the god Shiva in his play, and also the Abhira names (known from their inscriptions) recommend that they were Shaivites.
